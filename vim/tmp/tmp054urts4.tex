Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $n^2+1$ has a prime divisor greater than $2n+\sqrt{2n}$.

I claim for all sufficiently large $p\equiv1\pmod4$, the smaller square root $n$ of $-1$ modulo $p$ (that is, with $2n<p$) satisfies $p>2n+\sqrt{2n}$.

We use this stupid bound: $(p-2n)^2\equiv(2n)^2\equiv4\pmod p$, so $(p-2n)^2+4\ge p$. We obtain the quadratic $p^2-(4n+1)p+4\left(n^2+1\right)$. As $2n<p$, we take $p$ the larger root \[p=2n+\frac12+\sqrt{2n-\frac{15}4}>2n+\sqrt{2n}\]
for sufficiently large $n$.
\begin{remark}
    We can check that this argument works for $p\ge29$, and $p=17$ can be checked manually. Hence the only exceptions are $p=5$ and $p=13$.
