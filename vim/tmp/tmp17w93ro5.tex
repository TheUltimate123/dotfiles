Bored in an infinitely long class, Evan jots down a fraction whose numerator and denominator are both $70$-character strings, as follows: \[r=\frac{loooloolloolloololllloloollollolllloollloloolooololooolololooooollllol}
{lolooloolollollolloooooloooloololloolllooollololoooollllooolollloloool}.\]
If $o=2013$ and $l=\frac1{50}$, find $\lceil roll\rceil$.

Note $l<o$ and $l$ is shorter than $o$. Since the numerator is shorter than the denominator, the numerator is less than the denominator, so $r<1$. Also $oll<1$, so $roll<1$ and the answer is $1$.
