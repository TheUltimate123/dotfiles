Find all functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that for all $x,y\in\mathbb R$ we have \[f(x^2+yf(x))=xf(x+y).\]

The answer is $f\equiv0$ and $f(x)=x$, which work. Let $P(x,y)$ denote assertion. $P(x,0)$ gives $f(x^2)=xf(x)$. This also gives that $f$ is odd, and consequently $f(0)=0$. Now $P(x,-x)$ gives $0=f\left(x^2-xf(x)\right)=f\left(x^2-f(x^2)\right)$, and since $f$ is odd, $f(x-f(x))=0$ for all $x$.

Say we have a $z\ne0$ with $f(z)=0$. Then $zf(z)=f(z^2)=zf(z+x)$ for all $x$, so $f(z+x)=f(z)=0$ for all $z$, and $f\equiv0$. Proof complete.
