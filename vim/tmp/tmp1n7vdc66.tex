Let $n\ge 3$ be an integer. Prove that there exists a set $S$ of $2n$ distinct positive integers such that for any $m\in\{2,\ldots,n\}$, the set $S$ can be partitioned into two sets with cardinalities $m$ and $2n-m$ with equal sums.

We claim that this generalizable set works:
\begin{align*}
    S&=\{1,11,111,1111,11111,\\
    &\qquad 12,123,1234,a,b\},
\end{align*}
where $a$ and $b$ are chosen such that the sum of the first five elements equals the sum of the latter half.

Now, consider the subset $\{1,11,111,1111,11111\}$. To reduce the size, coalesce the two smallest terms. For instance, the next largest subset is $\{12,111,1111,11111\}$, all the way to $\{1234,11111\}$, so this works.
