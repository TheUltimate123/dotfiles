Let $P(x)$ be the monic polynomial with rational coefficients of minimal degree such that $\frac1{\sqrt2}$, $\frac1{\sqrt3}$, $\frac1{\sqrt4}$, $\ldots$, $\frac1{\sqrt{1000}}$ are roots of $P$. What is the sum of the coefficients of $P$?

Irrational $\frac1{\sqrt r}$ have another Galois conjugate $-\frac1{\sqrt r}$. Thus $-\frac1{\sqrtr}$ is also a root of $P$ for all $r$ that are not perfect squares. It follows that \[P(x)=\frac{(x^2-\frac12)(x^2-\frac13)\cdots(x^2-\frac1{1000})}{(x+\frac12)(x+\frac13)\cdots(x+\frac1{31})}.\]
The sum of the coefficients of $P$ is obtained by taking $x=1$, and the numberator and denominator both telescope: \[P(1)=\frac{\frac12\cdot\frac23\cdots\frac{999}{1000}}{\frac32\cdot\frac43\cdots\frac{32}{31}}=\frac1{16000}.\]

$\frac1{16000}$
