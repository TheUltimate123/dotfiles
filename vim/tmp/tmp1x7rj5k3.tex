The sequence $(a_n)$ is defined recursively by $a_0=1,a_1=\sqrt[19]2$, and $a_n=a_{n-1}a_{n-2}^2$ for $n\ge 2$. What is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that the product $a_1a_2\cdots a_k$ is an integer?

Let $a_n=2^{b_n/19}$ for all $i$. Then, $b_0=0,b_1=1$, and for all $n\ge 2$, $b_n=b_{n-1}+2b_{n-2}$. The characteristic polynomial is then $0=k^2-k-2=(k-2)(k+1)$. Solving, \[b_n=\frac13\left(2^n-(-1)^n\right).\]
For $a_1a_2\cdots a_k$ to be an integer, if $k$ is odd, we need $19\mid\frac{2^{k+1}-2}3$ and if $k$ is even, $19\mid\frac{2^{k+1}-1}3$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{17+1}\equiv 1\pmod{19}$, and clearly $2^{17+1}\equiv 1\pmod{3}$, so $a_1a_2\cdots a_{17}$ is an integer. It is the smallest answer choice, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }17}$.
