Find all real numbers $x$, $y$, $z$ which satisfy
\begin{align*}
    x^3&=3x-12y+50,\\
    y^3&=12y+3z-2,\\
    z^3&=27z+27x.
\end{align*}

Rewrite the conditions as
\begin{alignat*}2
    y&=\tfrac1{12}(3x-x^3+50)&&=4-\tfrac1{12}(x-2)(x+1)^2,\\
    z&=\tfrac13(y^3-12y+2)&&=6+\tfrac13(y-4)(y+2)^2,\\
    x&=\tfrac1{27}(z^3-27z)&&=2+\tfrac1{27}(z-6)(z+3)^2.
\end{alignat*}
Finally $x>2\implies y<4\implies z\le6\implies x\le2$ and $x<2\implies y\ge4\implies z\ge6\implies x\ge2$, whence the only solution is $(2,4,6)$, which clearly works.
