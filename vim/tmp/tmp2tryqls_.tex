Let $n\ge3$ be an integer. A sequence $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of real numbers is \emph{shiny} if any permutation $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ of the sequence obeys \[y_1y_2+y_2y_3+\cdots+y_{n-1}y_n\ge-1.\]
Determine (in terms of $n$) the largest constant $K$ such that for every shiny sequence $x_1$, \ldots, $x_n$ we have \[\sum_{1\le i<j\le n}x_ix_j\ge K.\]

The answer is $\frac{1-n}2$, achieved by taking $(\veps,\veps,\ldots,\veps,s/\veps)$ for $s=-\frac12$ and $\veps\to0^+$. There are two main cases to consider:

\bigskip

\textbf{First case:} Say the number of nonnegative elements and the number of negative elements of $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ are not equal. Then for each permutation $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$, there is an index $i$ with $y_iy_{i-1}\ge0$, so $y_1y_2+\cdots+y_ny_1\ge-1$.

Sum this bound over all permutations to obtain \[\sum_{i<j}x_ix_j\ge-\frac{\binom n2}n=\frac{1-n}2.\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Second case:} Say the number of nonnegative elements and the number of negative elements of $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ are equal; in particular, $n$ is even. Without loss of generality $x_i<0$ for $i\le n$ and $x_i\ge0$ for $i\ge n$.

By summing $y_1y_2+\cdots+y_{n-1}y_n\ge-1$ over permutations where $y_{2i-1}<0$ and $y_{2i}\ge0$ for each $i$, we have \[\sum_{i\le n}\sum_{j>n}x_ix_j\ge\frac{n^2}{4(1-n)}.\]
This already finishes, since \[\sum_{i<j}x_ix_j\ge\sum_{i\le n}\sum_{j>n}x_ix_j\ge\frac{n^2}{4(1-n)}>\frac{1-n}2\]
for all $n\ge4$.
