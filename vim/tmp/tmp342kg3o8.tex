Call a set $A$ of integers \emph{admissible} if for all (not necessarily distinct) elements $x$, $y$ of $A$, we have $x^2+kxy+y^2\in A$ for every integer $k$.
Determine all nonzero integers $m$, $n$ such that the only admissible set containing both $m$ and $n$ is the set of all integers.

The answer is $m$, $n$ relatively prime. For necessity, the set of multiples of $\gcd(m,n)$ always works.

If $m$, $n$ are relatively prime, we will show $1\in A$, and the result will follow. First we construct all multiples of $m^2$ by $x=y=m$; similarly we have all multiples of $n^2$. By B\'ezout for some $a$, $b$, we have $am^2-bn^2=1$, so taking $x=am^2$, $y=bn^2$, $k=-2$ gives $1\in A$.
