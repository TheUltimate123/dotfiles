Find the number of nonempty subsets $S$ of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,10\}$ such that $S$ has an even number of elements, and the product of the elements of $S$ is even.

\begin{answer}
    496
\end{answer}
The number of $S$ with an even number of elements is $2^9$, by choosing for $i=1,\ldots,9$ whether $i$ is in $S$, and whether $10$ is in $S$ is dependent on parity.

All $S$ without an even product of elements contains only odd elements. The number of such $S$ is $2^4$, by choosing for $i=1,3,5,7$ whether $i$ is in $S$, and whether $9$ is in $S$ is dependent on parity.

The answer is $2^9-2^4=496$.
