Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $ab+1$ divides $a^2+b^2$. Show that \[\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}\]
is the square of an integer.

Let $k$ be a positive integers, and consider solutions to $k=\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}$. The first observation is that $ab\ge0$, so it is impossible for one of $a,b$ to be positive while the other is negative.

Writing this equation as a quadratic in $a$, \[a^2-kb\cdot a+b^2-k=0,\]
so for every solution $(a,b)$, with $a\ge b$, we have another solution $(a',b)$, where \[a'=kb-a=\frac{b^2-k}a\]
is the other root of the quadratic. Note that $a'=\frac{b^2-k}a<a$, but $b$ is the same, so eventually there is a solution with $0\in\{a,b\}$.

This implies $k$ is a perfect square, as desired.
