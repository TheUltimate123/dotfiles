A finite graph $G$ is drawn on a blackboard. The following operation is permitted: pick any cycle $C$ of $G$, draw a new vertex $v$, connect it to all vertices of $C$, and finally erase all the edges of $C$. Prove that the operation can only be done a finite number of times.

Let $V$ be the number of vertices and $E$ the number of edges. Then $V$ increases by one each operation, and $E$ is invariant. But the graph stays connected, so $V\le E+1$.
