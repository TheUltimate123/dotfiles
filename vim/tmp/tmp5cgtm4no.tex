Let $ABC$ be a triangle. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ touches sides $AC$ and $AB$ at $Y$ and $Z$, respectively. Let $G$ be the point where $\seg{BY}$ and $\seg{CZ}$ meet, and let $R$ and $S$ be the points such that the two quadrilaterals $BYCR$ and $BZCS$ are parallelograms. Prove that $GR=GS$.

Let the incircle touch $\seg{BC}$ at $X$ and the $A$-excircle $\omega_A$ touch $\seg{BC}$ at $X'$ and $\seg{AC}$ at $Y'$. Denote by $\omega_R$ and $\omega_S$ the circles centered at $R$ and $S$ respectively with radius $0$. Note that $BR=CY=CX=BX'$ and $YR=BC=AY'-AY=YY'$, so $\seg{BY}$ is the radical axis of $\omega_A$ and $\omega_R$. Similarly $\seg{CZ}$ is the radical axis of $\omega_A$ and $\omega_S$, so $G$ is the radical center of $\omega_A$, $\omega_R$, $\omega_S$ and therefore equidistant from $R$ and $S$.
