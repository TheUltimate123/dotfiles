Five identical empty buckets of $2$-liter capacity stand at the vertices of a regular pentagon. Cinderella and her wicked Stepmother go through a sequence of rounds. At the start of each round, the Stepmother distributes one liter of water arbitrarily over the five buckets. Then Cinderella chooses two neighboring buckets and empties them; the next round then begins. Can Cinderella always prevent the Stepmother from causing a bucket to overflow?

Cinderella wins. Say a configuration is \emph{good} if we can label volumes of the buckets $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ in order around the perimeter of the pentagon such that $A=B=0$, $C+E<1$, $D<1$. It is clear the initial configuration is good.
\begin{iclaim*}
Given a good configuration, Cinderella can guarantee the configuration is still good after a round.
\end{iclaim*}
\begin{proof}
    After the Stepmother distributes the water, let the volume of the bucket labeled $A$ become $A'$, and so on. Note that $A'+B'+C'+E'<2$, so either $A'+C'<1$ or $B'+E'<1$; assume without loss of generality the former holds. Let Cinderella empty the buckets $D'$, $E'$, so that $D'=E'=0$, $A'+C'<1$, $B'<1$. This proves the claim.
\end{proof}

The Stepmother can only win if at the beginning of a round, some bucket has volume at least $1$. Thus the Stepmother never wins.
