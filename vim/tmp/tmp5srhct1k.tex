Let $\mathcal P$ be a convex $n$-gon, and let $h>0$ be a real number. On each of the $n$ sides of $\mathcal P$ we erect internally a rectangle of height $h$ (meaning the rectangle shares a side with $\mathcal P$ and moreover the interiors overlap). Prove that it's possible to pick a $h$ such that the $n$ rectangles together cover the interior of $\mathcal P$, and moreover the sum of their areas is at most twice the area of $\mathcal P$.

Let the polygon be $A_1A_2\cdots A_n$ (with $A_{n+1}=A_1$), and let $A$ be its area and $P$ its perimeter. We want to show that for all points $X$ in the interior of $\mathcal P$, the shortest distance from $X$ to the sides of the polygon is at most $2A/P$. However \[A=\sum_{i=1}^n[XA_iA_{i+1}]=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{A_iA_{i+1}\cdot\operatorname{dist}(X,\seg{A_iA_{i+1}})}2.\]
Since $P=\sum_{i=1}^nA_iA_{i+1}$, by Pigeonhole there is an $i$ with $\operatorname{dist}(X,\seg{A_iA_{i+1}})\le 2A/P$, completing the proof.
