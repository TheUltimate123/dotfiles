Let $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$ be an arbitrary infinite sequence of positive numbers. Show that the inequality $1+a_n>a_{n-1}\sqrt[n]2$ holds for infinitely many positive integers $n$.

It is clear $2^{1/n}\le1+n^{-1}$ for all $n\ge1$. We will show $1+a_n>a_{n-1}\left(1+n^{-1}\right)$ holds for infinitely many $n$.

Assume not --- that for all $n>N$, we have $1+a_n\le a_{n-1}\left(1+n^{-1}\right)$. Then we can show
\begin{align*}
    a_{N+1}&\le\left(\frac{N+2}{N+1}\right)a_N-1\\
    a_{N+2}&\le\left(\frac{N+3}{N+1}\right)a_N-\frac{N+3}{N+2}-1\\
    &\,\vdots\\
    a_{N+M}&\le\left(\frac{N+M+1}{N+1}\right)a_N-\sum_{i=1}^M\frac{N+M+1}{N+i+1}.
\end{align*}
We finish by noting this is eventually negative.
