A rectangle $\mathcal R$ with odd integer side lengths is divided into small rectangles with integer side lengths. Prove that there is at least one among the small rectangles whose distances from the four sides of $\mathcal R$ are either all odd or all even.

Checkerboard color $\mathcal R$ so that its corners are black. Then we are looking for a rectangle whose corners are also all black. Note that a rectangle has black corners if and only if it has more black squares than white squares. Since $\mathcal R$ has more black squares than white squares, such a rectangle exists.
