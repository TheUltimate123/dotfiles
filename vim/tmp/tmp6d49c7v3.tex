Let $ABC$ be a triangle satisfying $AC+BC=3AB$. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ has center $I$ and touches sides $BC$ and $CA$ at points $D$ and $E$, respectively. Let $K$ and $L$ be the reflections of points $D$ and $E$ across $I$. Prove that points $A$, $B$, $K$, $L$ are concyclic.

Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\seg{CB}$ and $\seg{CA}$ respectively. By Pitot's theorem, $\seg{MN}$ is tangent to the incircle, say at a point $T$. Let the $A$-excircle touch $\seg{CB}$ at $D'$ and the $B$-excircle touch $\seg{CA}$ at $E'$. By inspection, $D$, $D'$, $T$ lie on a circle centered at $M$, but by homothety $A$, $K$, $D'$ are collinear. Then $\angle ATD=\angle D'TD=90\dg=\angle KTD$, so $A$, $K$, $T$ are collinear.

Similarly $B$, $L$, $T$ are collinear, so $A$, $B$, $K$, $L$ are collinear by Reim's theorem.
