Find, with proof, the least integer $N$ such that if any $2016$ elements are removed from the set $1,2,\ldots,N$, one can still find $2016$ distinct numbers among the remaining elements with sum $N$.

The answer is $1008\cdot 6049=6097392$.

We first show that this works. Split the first $6048$ terms into the $3024$ pairs \[(1,6048),(2,6047),(3,6046),\ldots,(3024,3025).\]
If we remove $2016$ elements, at least $1008$ pairs have both of their elements remaining, so a sum of $1008\cdot 6049$ is achievable. To show that this is minimal, note that if we remove $2016$ terms of any sequence, the minimum possible sum of $2016$ distinct elements is \[2017+2018+2019+\cdots+4032=6097392,\]
as required.
