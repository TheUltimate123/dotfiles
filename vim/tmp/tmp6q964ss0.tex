Evan has a simple graph $G$ with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges. Show that he can delete at least $\frac{e-v+1}2$ edges so that each vertex still has at least half of its original degree.

Evidently we may assume $G$ is connected. We will induct on $e$, with base case $e=v-1$ where $G$ is a tree and we remove no edges. Henceforth $e\ge v$, so there is at least one cycle.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If there is an even-length cycle, then remove the cycle, apply the inductive hypothesis on the resulting graph, and add back every other edge of the even-length cycle.
    \item If there are no even-length cycles, then all odd-length cycles are disjoint, so the number of cycles is $e-v+1$. Simply remove an edge from each cycle.
\end{itemize}
That is all.
