Let $n$ be a positive integer. Partition the set $\{0,\ldots,2n-1\}$ into $n$ pairs $\{a_1,b_1\}$, $\{a_2,b_2\}$, $\ldots$, $\{a_n,b_n\}$. For $i=1,\ldots,n$ draw a semicircle above the $x$-axis joining $(a_i,0)$ to $(b_i,0)$, and draw a semicircle below the $x$-axis joining $(a_i+1,0)$ and $(b_i+1,0)$.

Suppose that no two of these semicircles intersect except at their endpoints. Prove that the union of the semicircles forms a single closed curve from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$.

Consider a graph in which upper semicircles are red edges and lower semicircles are blue edges. Assume for contradiction otherwise; then there must be a cycle since there are $2n+1$ vertices and $2n$ edges.

Take such a cycle, and consider its rightmost point $y$, and the point $x$ such that there is a red edge $\{x,y\}$. By problem statement, there is a blue edge between $\{x+1,y+1\}$. Furthermore, the edges of the cycle alternate colors.

        draw( (0,0)--(7,0));
        draw(arc( (3,0),3,0,180,CCW),red);
        draw(arc( (2,0),1,0,180,CCW),red+dashed);
        draw(arc( (.5,0),.5,180,0,CCW),blue);
        draw(arc( (4.5,0),1.5,180,0,CCW),blue+dashed);
        draw(arc( (4,0),3,180,0,CCW),blue);

        for(real i=0;i<=7+1e-9;i+=1)
        dot( (i,0));
    \end{asy}
\end{center}
By the assumption that $y$ is the rightmost point, the blue edge $\{x+1,y+1\}$ is not a part of the cycle. Since no semicircles in the path can intersect the lower semicircle from $\{x+1,y+1\}$, the cycle must contain $x+1$. In particular, there is another blue edge incident to $x+1$, contradiction.
