Find all positive integers $n$ such that $2^n+12^n+2011^n$ is a perfect square.

---

The answer is $n=1$. Assume that $n\ge2$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taking this modulo $3$, $(-1)^n+1^n$ must be a quadratic residue $\{0,1\}\pmod3$, so $n$ cannot be even.
    \item Taking this modulo $4$ (and recalling $n\ge2$), $(-1)^n$ must be a quadratic residue $\{0,1\}\pmod4$, so $n$ cannot be odd.
\end{itemize}
Thus no $n\ge2$ work.
