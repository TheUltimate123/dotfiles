The positive integer $N$ can be written as $\underline a\;\underline b\;\underline c\;\underline d$ in base $7$, and $\underline r\;\underline s\;\underline t$ in base $9$. Suppose that the value of the digit $d$ is the sum of the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, and that the value of the digit $r$ is the sum of the values of $s$ and $t$. Furthermore, the values of $c$ and $d$ are double the values of $s$ and $t$, respectively. Find $N$.

We know that \[N=a\cdot 7^3+b\cdot 7^2+(2s)\cdot 7+(a+b+2s)=344a+50b+16s.\]
Furthermore, \[N=\left(\frac{a+b}2+2s\right)\cdot 9^2+s\cdot 9+\left(\frac{a+b}2+s\right)=41a+41b+172s.\]
Setting the two expressions equal, we have that $101a+3b=52s$. However, since $s$ is a digit in base $7$, we have that $s\in\{0,1,2,3\}$.
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item If $s=0$, then $a=b=0$ and $N=0$, which is not positive.
    \item If $s=1$, then $101a+3b=52$, which is impossible if $a,b<7$.
    \item If $s=2$, then $101a+3b=104$, so $a=b=1$. This yields $N=426$
    \item If $s=3$, then $101a+3b=156$, which is impossible if $a,b<7$.
\end{itemize}
Hence, the answer is $426$.
