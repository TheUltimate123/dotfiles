Find all pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ such that $(xy+1)(xy+x+2)$ is a perfect square.

The answer is no. The assumption $k^2=(xy+1)(xy+x+2)$ rearranges to \[(y-1)^2=\big[2y(y+1)x+(3y+1)\big]^2-4y(y+1)k^2.\]
Set $u=2y(y+1)x+(3y+1)$ and $v=k$, so it suffices to show that there is no solution to the Pell-like equation $(y-1)^2=u^2-4y(y+1)v^2$ with $u\equiv3k+1\pmod{2y(y+1)}$. Assume for contradiction such a solution exists.

Define $N(u,v)=u^2-4y(y+1)v^2$ as the norm of $u+v\sqrt{4y(y+1)}$. It is clear that the fundamental unit in $\mathbb Z_{>0}\big[\sqrt{4y(y+1)}\big]$ is $(2y+1)+\sqrt{4y(y+1)}$. In other words, the solutions $(u_i,v_i)$ to the Pell-like equation are described by the recurrence \[(u_{i+1},v_{i+1})=\Big( (2y+1)u+4y(y+1)v,\;u+(2y+1)v\Big).\]
Furthermore one solution is $(2y^2-y-1,y-1)$. In this solution, $u\equiv-(3y+1)\pmod{2y(y+1)}$. Thus if we consider $u$ modulo $2y(y+1)$, there is a $t$ such that $-(3y+1)(2y+1)^t\equiv(3y+1)\pmod{2y(y+1)}$, or equivalently $(2y+1)^t\equiv-1\pmod{2y(y+1)}$.

However note that $2y+1\not\equiv-1\pmod{2y(y+1)}$, but $(2y+1)^2\equiv1\pmod{2y(y+1)}$, hence the equivalence $(2y+1)^t\equiv-1\pmod{2y(y+1)}$ is impossible.
