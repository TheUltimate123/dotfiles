Suppose $X$ is a random variable that takes on only nonnegative integer values, with $\mathbb E[X]=1$, $\mathbb E[X^2]=2$, and $\mathbb E[X^3]=5$. Determine the smallest possible value of the probability of the event $X=0$.

Let $p(n)$ be the probability $n$ is chosen. The answer is $1/3$, with equality when $p(0)=1/3$, $p(1)=1/2$, $p(3)=1/6$, and everything else zero. To check that this is minimal, consider the polynomial defined by $f(n)=(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)=n^3-6n^2+11n-6$. Summing, \[\sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)p(n)=5-6\cdot2+11\cdot1-6\cdot1=-2.\]
However for all $n\ge1$, $f(n)p(n)\ge0$, so $f(0)p(0)\le-2$, and $p(0)\ge1/3$, completing the proof.
