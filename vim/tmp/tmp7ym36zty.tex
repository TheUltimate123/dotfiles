Find all integers $n\ge3$ such that among any $n$ positive real numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, \ldots, $a_n$ with
\[\max(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\le n\cdot\min(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n),\]
there exist three that are the side lengths of an acute triangle.

The answer is $n\ge13$. Define the Fibonacci sequence by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for $n\ge3$.
\begin{claim*}
    $F_n\le n^2$ if and only if $n\le12$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    Verify the hypothesis by hand for $n\le14$. Then if $F_{n-1}>(n-1)^2$ and $F_{n-2}>(n-2)^2$ for $n\ge15$, it follows that \[F_n>(n-1)^2+(n-2)^2>n^2,\]
    so the claim follows inductively.
\end{proof}

Sort the numbers in increasing order $a_1\le a_2\le\cdots\le a_n$. For $n\le12$, any sequence with $a_n=\sqrt{F_n}\cdot a_1$ obeys the inequality, but no three form the sides of an acute triangle.

On the other hand, for $n\ge13$, if no three elements of the sequence form an acute triangle, then we can write
\begin{align*}
    a_1^2+a_2^2&\le a_3^2\\
    a_2^2+a_3^2&\le a_4^2\\
    &\;\vdots\\
    a_{n-1}^2+a_{n-2}^2&\le a_n^2.
\end{align*}
It is not hard to verify by induction on $k$ that $a_k^2\ge F_ka_1^2$, so the inequality $a_n\le na_1$ fails.
