Prove that \[\sum\frac1{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}=n,\]
where the summation is taken over all non-empty subsets $\{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k\}$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.

Whether $1\le i\le n$ is an element of a subset is chosen independently: the sum is actually \[-1+\prod_{i=1}^n\left(1+\frac1i\right)=n\]
by telescoping.
