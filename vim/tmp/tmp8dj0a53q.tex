Prove that there exists a positive integer $n<10^6$ such that $5^n$ has six consecutive zeros in its decimal representation.

We claim that $n=2^{19}+20$ works. It is easy to check that $n<10^6$. Clearly \[5^{2^{19}+20}\equiv 5^{20}\pmod{5^{20}}.\]
Furthermore, since $\phi(2^{20})=2^{19}$, \[5^{2^{19}+20}\equiv 5^{20}\pmod{2^{20}}.\]
Hence, $5^n\equiv 5^{20}\pmod{10^{20}}$. It is easy to check that \[\frac{10^{20}}{5^{20}}=2^{20}>10^6,\]
so $n$ works.
