Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers such that $m>n$. Define $x_k=(m+k)/(n+k)$ for $k=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $n+1$. Prove that if all the numbers $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_{n+1}$ are integers, then $x_1x_2\cdots x_{n+1}-1$ is divisible by an odd prime.

Let \[L=\lcm(n+1,\,n+2,\,\ldots,\,2n+1).\]
Since $x_k-1=(m-n)/(n+k)$ is an integer for all $k$, $L\mid m-n$. Say that $m-n=LT$ for some integer $T$, so that we want to show \[\prod_{k=1}^{n+1}\left(\frac L{n+k}T+1\right)-1\]
is not a power of $2$. First note that if $T$ is divisible by an odd prime $p$, then the whole expression is divisible by $p$, and we are already done. Henceforth assume $T$ is a power of $2$.

It is easy to see that exactly one of the numbers $n+1$, $n+2$, $\ldots$, $2n+1$ is a power of $2$, and hence $L/(n+k)$ is odd exactly once. Thus upon expanding the above expression and extracting a factor of $T$, only the constant term is odd; all other coefficients are the sum of even integers and thus even, so the whole expression is odd for all $T$, as desired.
