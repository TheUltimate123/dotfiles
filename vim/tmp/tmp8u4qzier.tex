Determine whether there exist two functions $f,g:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $f\circ g$ is strictly decreasing but $g\circ f$ is strictly increasing.

---

The answer is yes. Let $g(0)=0$. For each nonzero $x$, if $k$ is the integer such that $|x|\in[2^k,2^{k+1})$, then take $g(x)=(-1)^kx$. Also take $f(x)=g(2x)$ for all $x$. Then
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item $f(g(x))=g(2g(x))=(-1)^{k+1}\cdot(-1)^kx=-x$, which is strictly decreasing;
    \item $g(f(x))=g(g(2x))=(-1)^k\cdot(-1)^kx=x$, which is strictly increasing.
\end{itemize}
End proof.
