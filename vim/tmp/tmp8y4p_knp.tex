Consider the sequence $\{F_n\}$ defined by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for all $n>2$. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}=\{F_2,F_3,\ldots,F_{2019}\}$. Then, there are $T$ non-congruent triangles with positive area whose side lengths are all (not necessarily distinct) elements of $\mathcal{F}$. Find the remainder when $T$ is divided by $1000$.

We claim that no scalene triangle works. Assume for the sake of contradiction that a triangle with sides $F_a<F_b<F_c$ works. Then, $$F_a+F_b\le F_{b-1}+F_b=F_{b+1}\le F_c,$$
a contradiction. Hence, the triangle is isosceles. If the leg has length $F_2=1$, then only $F_2$ works for the base. If $i>2$ and the leg has length $F_i$, since $$2F_i>F_{i-1}+F_i=F_{i+1},\text{ but }2F_i<F_i+F_{i+1}=F_{i+2},$$
the other leg must be $\{F_2,F_3,\ldots,F_{i+1}\}$. However, for $i=2019$, $F_{2020}$ is not in $\mathcal{F}$, so the requested remainder is
\begin{align*}
    1+3+4+\cdots+2017+2018+2018&\equiv\frac{2019\cdot 2020}2-3\\
    &\equiv 19\cdot 10-3\\
    &\equiv 187\pmod{1000},
\end{align*}
and we are done.
