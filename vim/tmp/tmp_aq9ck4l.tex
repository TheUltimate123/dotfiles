Given that $n+2$ and $2n-3$ are the squares of two consecutive integers, what is the sum of all possible values of $n$?

---

Suppose that $n+2=k^2$. Then, $2n-3=(k+1)^2$. This substitution works because if $n+2>2n-3$, then we can simply take $k$ negative. Thus, $n=k^2-2$ and \[(k+1)^2=2(k^2-2)-3=2k^2-7\implies 0=k^2-2k-8=(k-4)(k+2).\]
It follows that $k=4$ or $-2$, whence $n=14$ and $2$, respectively. The requested sum is $14+2=16$.
