Find all nonnegative integer solutions $(a,b,c,d)$ to the equation \[2^a3^b-5^c7^d=1.\]

---

The answers are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(1,1,1,0)$, $(2,2,1,1)$, $(3,0,0,1)$.
\begin{iclaim*}
    If $a,b,c,d>0$, then $(a,b,c,d)=(2,2,1,1)$.
\end{iclaim*}
\begin{proof}
    First assume $a\ge3$. Taking modulo $8$, we have $5^c7^d\equiv-1\pmod8$, however $5^c\in\{1,5\}$ and $7^d\in\{1,7\}$, so we must have $(5^c,7^d)=(1,7)$. It follows that $c$ is even and $d$ is odd. However taking modulo $6$, we have $-(-1)^c\equiv1\pmod6$, so $c$ is odd, contradiction.

    Hence we may take the following two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume $a=1$. Then $5^c7^d=2\cdot3^b-1$, so $2\cdot3^b\equiv1\pmod{35}$. This modulo $5$ gives $b\equiv1\pmod4$, and this modulo $7$ gives $b\equiv4\pmod6$, absurd.
        \item Assume $a=2$. Then $5^c7^d=4\cdot3^b-1$, so $4\cdot3^b\equiv1\pmod{35}$. Modulo $5$ gives $b$ is even, so \[5^c7^d=(2\cdot3^{b/2}-1)(2\cdot3^{b+2}+1).\]
            The two terms are relatively prime, so they must be $5^c$ and $7^d$ in some order.

            That is, either $2\cdot3^{b/2}=5^c+1$ or $5^c-1$. By Zsigmondy theorem, $c\le2$, and it is easy to check that only $(2,2,1,1)$ works.
    \end{itemize}
    This exhausts all cases, thus proving the claim.
\end{proof}

To finish, note the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $a=0$, then the left-hand expression is even, so no solutions.
    \item If $b=0$, then $5^c7^d=2^a-1$, so by Zsigmondy theorem we need $a\le4$ or $a=6$, for which only $(1,0,0,0)$ and $(3,0,0,1)$ work.
    \item If $c=0$, then $2^a3^b=7^d+1$, but the right-hand expression is always $2\pmod3$, so $b=0$, and by Mih\u ailescu theorem only $(1,0,0,0)$ and $(3,0,0,1)$ work.
    \item If $d=0$, then $2^a3^b=5^c+1$, so by Zsigmondy theorem, $c\le2$, thus only $(1,0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1,0)$ work.
\end{itemize}
This completes the proof.
