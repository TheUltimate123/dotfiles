Let $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_{2n}$ be $2n$ distinct points on the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$, other than $(1,0)$. Each point is colored either red or blue, with exactly $n$ red points and $n$ blue points. Let $R_1,R_2,\ldots,R_n$ be any ordering of the red points. Let $B_1$ be the nearest blue point to $R_1$ traveling counterclockwise around the circle starting from $R_1$. Then let $B_2$ be the nearest of the remaining blue points to $R_2$ traveling counterclockwise around the circle from $R_2$, and so on, until we have labeled all of the blue points $B_1,\ldots,B_n$. Show that the number of counterclockwise arcs of the form $R_i\to B_i$ that contain the point $(1,0)$ is independent of the way we chose the ordering $R_1,\ldots,R_n$ of the red points.

If we progress from $(1,0)$ around the circle and keep track of $r$ and $b$, the number of red and blue points passed, respectively, the answer is the maximum value attained by $b-r$.

This is because if we remove $R_1$ and $B_1$, the difference changes appropriately: If $R_1\to B_1$ contains $(1,0)$, $B_1$ is before $R_1$, so $x$ decreases, and otherwise, $x$ remains invariant. Since $b-r$ is independent of the ordering of the red points, we are done.
