Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there exist polynomials $f_1$, $f_2$, $\ldots$, $f_n$ with rational coefficients satisfying \[x^2+7=f_1(x)^2+f_2(x)^2+\cdots+f_n(x)^2.\]

The answer is $5$, achieved by $f_1(x)=x$, $f_2(x)=2$, $f_3(x)=f_4(x)=f_5(x)=1$. We now prove $n=4$ is impossible.
\begin{iclaim*}
    No three rational squares sum to $7$.
\end{iclaim*}
\begin{proof}
    Assume $a^2+b^2+c^2=7d^2$ for integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. Then mod $8$ gives $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ even, so divide out $2$ and infinite descent.
\end{proof}

Since $f_i$ are linear, we can select $t\in\mathbb Q$ with $f_1(t)=\pm t$. If $n=4$, then $f_2(t)^2+f_3(t)^2+f_4(t)^2=7$, contradiction.
