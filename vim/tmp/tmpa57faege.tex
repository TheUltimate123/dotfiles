Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AC=5-\sqrt3$, $BC=\sqrt2$. Let $A'$, $B'$ be points outside of $\triangle ABC$ such that $\angle A'BC=15\dg$, $\angle A'CB=75\dg$, $\angle ACB'=60\dg$, $\angle B'AC=30\dg$. Given that $A'B'$ can be expressed in the form $a\sqrt b+c$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $a+b+c$.
