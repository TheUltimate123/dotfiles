Prove that $n^7+7$ is not a perfect square for any integer $n$.

---

Assume $n>0$, since $n=0$ and $n=-1$ are easily handled and $n^7+7<0$ for $n\le-2$.

If $n^7+7=a^2$ for some $a$, then \[n^7+2^7=a^2+11^2.\]
By modulo $4$, we have $n\equiv1\pmod4$, so $n+2\equiv3\pmod4$ but $n+2\mid n^7+2^7=a^2+11^2$.

By Fermat's Christmas theorem $a^2+11^2$ has no $3\pmod4$ prime divisors except $11$; in particular, $\nu_{11}\left(a^2+11^2\right)=2$. Then we have $\nu_{11}(n+2)$ is odd and at most $2$, so it equals $1$. However,
\[2=\nu_{11}\left(a^2+11^2\right)=\nu_{11}\left(n^7+2^7\right)=\nu_{11}(n+2)=1\]
by lifting the exponent, contradiction.
