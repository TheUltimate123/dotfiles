Call a convex equilateral polygon \emph{rhomboidal} if it can be tiled with a finite number of non-overlapping rhombi that have the same side length of the polygon. Prove that a convex equilateral polygon is rhomboidal if and only if each side of the polygon is parallel to some other side of the polygon.

We will prove that an equilateral polygon $\mathcal{P}$ is \textit{rhomboidal} iff for each side $\ell_i$ there exists another side $\ell'_i$ with $\ell_i \parallel \ell'_i$; this also means that $\mathcal{P}$ has an even number of sides.

\begin{itemize}
    \item\underline{Part 1:} If $\mathcal{P}$ is \textit{rhomboidal}, for each side $\ell_i$ there exists another side $\ell'_i$ with $\ell_i \parallel \ell'_i$.

        Suppose that $\mathcal{P}$ is $\textit{rhomboidal}$: each side of $\mathcal{P}$ must be a side of exactly one rhombus (if they were more than one, since the rhombi share the same side length of $\mathcal{P}$, the two or more rhombi would overlap). Let's start by placing a rhombus on the side $\ell_1$ of $\mathcal{P}$, and consider the side $a_1\parallel \ell_1$ of the rhombus: we place another rhombus on $a_1$, and we continue placing rhombi on the side $a_{n}$ of the $n^{\text{th}}$ rhombus, where $a_1\parallel a_2\parallel ...\parallel a_n$. Since we want to tile $\mathcal{P}$ with a finite number of rhombi, this construction should end at some point, so one of the sides $a_i\parallel \ell$ of the rhombi must be a side $\ell'_1$ of $\mathcal{P}$. Since this construction is valid for each side of $\mathcal{P}$, each side $\ell_i$ of $\mathcal{P}$ is parallel to one (and one only since $\mathcal{P}$ is convex) side $\ell'_i$ of the polygon. Hence our claim is proved; in particular, it follows that $\mathcal{P}$ has an even number of sides.

    \item\underline{Part 2:} For each side $\ell_i$ if  there exists another side $\ell'_i$ with $\ell_i \parallel \ell'_i$, then $\mathcal{P}$ is $\textit{rhomboidal}$.

        We will prove the claim by induction. Clearly, a quadrilateral with opposite and parallel sides is a rhombus. Suppose now that all equilateral polygons $\mathcal{P}$ of $2n$ sides with each side parallel to another side of the polygon are $\textit{rhomboidal}$. Consider $n+2$ consecutive vertices of an equilateral polygon $\mathcal{P}'$ with $2n+2$ sides: the first $3$ such vertices identify two sides of a rhombus (see the diagram, in blue); drawing the other two sides and using the same construction of Part 1, we place other $n-2$ rhombi (in light blue), each of them with two sides parallel to the one of the first rhombus, and this tiling closes on $\mathcal{P}'$ because of our hypothesis of parallelism. Hence, we are left with an equilateral polygon with $2n$ sides, which by our inductive hypothesis, is $\textit{rhomboidal}$. Hence, $\mathcal{P}'$ is $\textit{rhomboidal}$, and our claim has been proven. Done. $\square$
