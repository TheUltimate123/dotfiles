Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be positive real numbers. Prove that \[a^2+b^2+c^2\ge\sqrt{3\left(a^3b+b^3c+c^3a\right)}.\]

---

This inequality is infamously difficult since its equality cases are $a=b=c$ and cyclic permutations of $(a:b:c)=\left(\sin^2\frac{4\pi}7,\sin^2\frac{2\pi}7,\sin^2\frac\pi7\right)$.
\begin{remark}
    For this reason, the below solutions are more manipulation-flavored, and as such, the inequality \[\left(a^2+b^2+c^2\right)^2\ge3\left(a^3b+b^3c+c^3a\right)\]
    holds for all real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, not necesarily positive.
\end{remark}
\paragraph{First solution, by ``keep completing the square''} Indeed,
\[
    \left(a^2+b^2+c^2\right)^2-3\left(a^3b+b^3c+c^3a\right)
    =\frac12\cycsum\left(a^2-2ab+bc-c^2+ca\right)^2\ge0
\]

\paragraph{Second solution, by substitution} Note the standard inequality \[(x+y+z)^2\ge3(xy+yz+zx).\]
Substituting $x=a^2+b(c-a)$, $y=b^2+c(a-b)$, $z=c^2+a(b-c)$ gives the requested inequality.
