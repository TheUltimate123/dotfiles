A committee has an oligarchy, consisting of $A\%$ of the members of the committee. Suppose that $B\%$ of the work is done by the oligarchy. If the average amount of work done by a member of the oligarchy is $16$ times the amount of work done by a nonmember of the oligarchy, find the maximum possible value of $B-A$.

Scale $A$ and $B$ down by a factor of $100$. Assume that the committee has $1$ member who can be split into many pieces, and the committee does $1$ joule of work. Then\[16=\frac{B\text{ joules}}{A\text{ people}}\div\frac{(1-B)\text{ joules}}{(1-A)\text{ people}}=\frac B{1-B}\cdot\frac{1-A}A.\]Rearranging,\[B-AB=16A-16AB\implies A=\frac B{16-15B},\]so we want to maximize $f(x)=x-\tfrac x{16-15x}$ over $(0,1)$. Assume the expression equals $T$. Rearranging,\[0=15x^2-15(T+1)x+16T.\]To maximize $T$, we set the discriminant equal to $0$: this gives\[15^2(T+1)^2=15\cdot64T\implies0=T^2-\frac{34}{15}T+1.\]By Po's quadratic method, $T=\tfrac{17}{15}-\tfrac8{15}=\tfrac35$. The answer is $060$.
