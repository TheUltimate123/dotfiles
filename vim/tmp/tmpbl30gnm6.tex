There are $4n$ pebbles of weights 1, 2, 3, \ldots, $4n$. Each pebble is colored in one of $n$ colors and there are four pebbles of each color. Show that we can arrange the pebbles into two piles so that the following two conditions are both satisfied:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item The total weights of both piles are the same.
    \item Each pile contains two pebbles of each color.
\end{itemize}

We will show it is possible to find a subset $S$ of the pebbles such that
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item $S$ contains two pebbles of each color, and
    \item for each $i\le2n$, the pebble of weight $i$ is in $S$ if and only if $(4n+1)-i$ is in $S$.
\end{itemize}
Consider a (not necessarily simple) graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, each representing one of the $n$ colors. For each $i\le2n$, if the pebble of weight $i$ has color $a$ and the pebble of weight $(4n+1)-i$ has color $b$, draw an edge from $a$ to $b$. Thus, each $i\le2n$ represents an edge of $G$.

Then $G$ is a 4-regular graph, so by taking alternating edges of Eulerian circuits of each connected component, there is a 2-regular subgraph $G'$ with the same vertex set as $G$. If we let $S$ contain each edge that is present in $G'$, then $S$ obeys the desired conditions. End proof.
