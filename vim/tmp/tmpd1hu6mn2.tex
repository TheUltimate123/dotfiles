Call a permutation $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ of the integers $1,2,\ldots,n$ \emph{quasi-increasing} if $a_k\le a_{k+1}+2$ for each $1\le k\le n-1$. For example, $53421$ and $14253$ are quasi-increasing permutations of the integers $1,2,3,4,5$ but $45123$ is not. Find the number of quasi-increasing permutations of the integers $1,2,\ldots,7$.

We use recursion. Let $a_n$ be the number of quasi-increasing permutations of $1,2,\ldots,n$. Trivially, $a_2=2$. Then, for each $n>2$, given any quasi-increasing permutation of $1,2,\ldots,n-1$, we can place the number $n$ in front of either $n-1$ or $n-2$, or at the end. Hence, $a_n=3a_{n-1}$, and $a_7=486$.
