Does there exist an integer $n$ such that $n$ has exactly $2000$ distinct prime divisors and $n$ divides $2^n+1$?

The answer is yes. Clearly $n$ is odd, so consider $n=3^e\cdot k$, where $e\ge1$ and $3\nmid k$. Then  by lifting the exponent, \[\nu_3\left(2^n+1\right)=\nu_3\left(8^{3^{e-1}}+1\right)=e+1,\]
so we only need to consider primes $p>3$. Since $2^{3^e}+1\mid2^{3^e\cdot k}+1$ for all odd $k$, it suffices to show there are integers $k$ and $e$, with $3\nmid k$ and $k\mid2^{3^e}+1$, such that $k$ has exactly $1999$ distinct prime divisors. However by Zsigmondy theorem $2^{3^e}+1$ can have arbitrarily many prime divisors, the end.
