Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ lie on a circle $\omega$ and point $P$ lies outside the circle. The given points are such that (i) lines $PB$ and $PD$ are tangent to $\omega$, (ii) $P$, $A$, $C$ are collinear, and (iii) $\seg{DE}\parallel\seg{AC}$. Prove that $\seg{BE}$ bisects $\seg{AC}$.

We have $-1=(AC;BD)\stackrel E=(A,C;\seg{BE}\cap\seg{AC},\infty_{AC})$, as desired.
