Suppose that $f$ is a function on the interval $[1,3]$ such that $-1\le f(x)\le1$ for all $x$ and $\int_1^3f(x)\,dx=0$. Determine the largest possible value of \[\int_1^3\frac{f(x)}x\,dx.\]

The answer is $\log(4/3)$, with equality achieved by \[g(x)=\begin{cases}
        1&\text{if }x<2,\\
        -1&\text{if }x\ge2.
\end{cases}\]
It suffices to show that $\int_1^3\frac{f(x)}x\,dx\le\int_1^3\frac{g(x)}x\,dx$ for all $f$ as described in the problem. But \[\int_1^3\frac{g(x)-f(x)}x=\int_1^2\frac{1-f(x)}x-\int_2^3\frac{1+f(x)}x\ge\int_1^2\frac{1-f(x)}2-\int_2^3\frac{1+f(x)}2=0,\]
as desired.
