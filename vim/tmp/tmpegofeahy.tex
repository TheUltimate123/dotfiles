An integer is assigned to each vertex of a regular pentagon so that the sum of the five integers is 2011. A turn of a solitaire game consists of subtracting an integer $m$ from each of the integers at two neighboring vertices and adding $2m$ to the opposite vertex, which is not adjacent to either of the first two vertices. (The integer $m$ and the vertices chosen can vary from turn to turn.) The game is won at a certain vertex if, after some number of turns, that vertex has the number 2011 and the other four vertices have the number 0. Prove that for any choice of the initial integers, there is exactly one vertex at which the game can be won.

Let the numbers initially assigned to the vertices of the pentagon be $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$, respectively. Note that $a_1+2a_2+3a_3+4a_4$ is invariant modulo five, so at most one vertex can be the winning one. Without loss of generality this vertex is $a_0$, so $a_1+2a_2+3a_3+4a_4\equiv0\pmod5$.

Define the vectors \[\mathbf v_0=\begin{bmatrix}2\\0\\-1\\-1\\0\end{bmatrix},\quad\mathbf v_1=\begin{bmatrix}0\\2\\0\\-1\\-1\end{bmatrix},\quad\mathbf v_2=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\0\\2\\0\\-1\end{bmatrix},\quad\mathbf v_3=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\-1\\0\\2\\0\end{bmatrix},\quad\mathbf v_4=\begin{bmatrix}0\\-1\\-1\\0\\2\end{bmatrix}.\]
The task is to find integers $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$, $n_4$, $n_5$ such that \[\begin{bmatrix}2011\\0\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}=n_0\mathbf v_0+n_1\mathbf v_1+n_2\mathbf v_2+n_3\mathbf v_3+n_4\mathbf v_4.\]
Since $\mathbf v_0+\mathbf v_1+\mathbf v_2+\mathbf v_3+\mathbf v_4=0$, we may assume $n_0=0$, so we want to find an integer solution to the system of equations
\[
    \begin{cases}
        a_1=n_3+n_4-2n_1\\
        a_2=n_4-2n_2\\
        a_3=n_1-2n_3\\
        a_4=n_2+n_1-2n_4.
    \end{cases}
\]
Substitute $n_4=a_2+2n_2$ and $n_1=a_3+2n_3$ to obtain
\begin{align*}
    a_1&=n_3+(a_2+2n_2)-2(a_3+2n_3)=2n_2-3n_3+a_2-2a_3\\
    a_4&=n_2+(a_3+2n_3)-2(a_2+2n_2)=2n_3-3n_2+a_3-2n_2.
\end{align*}
Then it will suffice to solve the two-variable system
\[
    \begin{cases}
        2n_2-3n_3=a_1-a_2+2a_3\\
        2n_3-3n_2=a_4-a_3+2n_2.
    \end{cases}
\]
Since $n_2+n_3=-(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4)$, we have
\begin{align*}
    5n_2&=(a_1-a_2+2a_3)-3(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4)\\
    &=-2a_1-4a_2-a_3-3a_4\\
    &=-2(a_1+2a_2+3a_3+4a_4)\\
    &\equiv0\pmod5.
\end{align*}
Hence $n_2$, $n_3$ are integers, thus so are $n_1$, $n_4$, and we are done.
