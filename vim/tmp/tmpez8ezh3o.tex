Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers such that $x^2-xy+2y^2=8$. Find the maximum possible value of $x^2+xy+2y^2$.

---

Note that \[8+xy=x^2+2y^2\ge2\sqrt2\cdot xy\implies xy\le\frac8{2\sqrt2-1}=\frac{16\sqrt2+8}7.\]
Hence \[x^2+xy+2y^2=8+2xy\le\frac{72+32\sqrt2}7.\]

$\frac{72+32\sqrt2}7$
