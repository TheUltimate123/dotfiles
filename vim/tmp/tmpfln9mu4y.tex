Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be real numbers such that $a+b+c=1$ and $a,b,c\ge-\frac34$. Show that \[\frac a{a^2+1}+\frac b{b^2+1}+\frac c{c^2+1}\le\frac9{10}.\]

It can be seen that \[\frac x{x^2+1}\le\frac{18}{25}x+\frac3{50}\iff0\le(4x+3)(3x-1)^2\]
for all $x\ge-3/4$. Summing this over $a$, $b$, $c$ yields the desired inequality.
