Let $ABC$ be triangle with incenter $I$. A point $P$ in the interior of the triangle satisfies \[\angle PBA+\angle PCA=\angle PBC+\angle PCB.\]
Show that $AP\ge AI$, and that equality holds if and only if $P=I$.

The key observation:
\begin{claim*}
    $P$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle BIC$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    With directed angles, check that
    \begin{align*}
        \da BPC&=\da PBC+\da BCP\\
        &=\da ABP+\da PCA\\
        &=\da CPB+\da BAC,
    \end{align*}
    so $2\da BPC=\da BAC$. Since $\angle BPC>\angle BAC$, we must have $\angle BPC=90\dg+\frac12\angle BAC$.
\end{proof}

By the Incenter-Excenter lemma, the circumcenter of $\triangle BIC$ lies on line $AI$, so the circle centered at $A$ with radius $AI$ is externally tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle BIC$ at $I$. The problem readily follows.
