Over all $N>0$, what is the maximum possible number of permutations $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$ of the integers $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$ such that it is possible to put parentheses around the expression\[a\div b\div c\div d\div e\]
so that it equals $N$?

Note that $a$ and $b$ end up in the numerator and denominator respectively, but $c$, $d$, $e$ can go anywhere. That is, for all $x,y,z\in\{1,-1\}$, the expression can attain $ab^{-1}c^xd^ye^z$. Optimally the exponents of $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$ in $N$ are all $\pm1$, whereas all other exponents are $0$. Say that there are $p$ exponents of $1$ and $q$ exponents of $-1$.

We can choose $a$ in $p$ ways and $b$ in $q$ ways. Next, $c$, $d$, $e$ may be any of the $6$ permutations of the remaining primes, and $x$, $y$, $z$ follow accordingly. Then the number of permutations is given by $6pq\le6\cdot2\cdot3=36$, the answer.
