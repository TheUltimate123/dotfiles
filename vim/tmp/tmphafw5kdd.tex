Let $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$ be a sequence of integers with infinitely many positive and negative terms. Suppose that for every positive integer $n$ the numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ leave $n$ different remainders upon division by $n$.

Prove that every integer occurs exactly once in the sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$.

Clearly the sequence contains no duplicate element. We can interpret the modulo $n$ condition as $|a_i-a_j|<\max(i,j)$ for all $i$, $j$; if this fails, then take $n=|a_i-a_j|$.
\begin{claim*}
    For all $n$, the set $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ contains $n$ consecutive integer.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $n$. For the base case $n=1$ there is nothing to show. Now assume the hypothesis for $n-1$, and let $a_i$ and $a_j$ be minimal and maximal respectively among $a_1$, \ldots, $a_{n-1}$, so that $a_j-a_i=n-2$. We have $|a_n-a_i|\le n-1$, so $a_n\le a_j+1$, and $|a_n-a_j|\le n-1$, so $a_n\ge a_i-1$. Since the sequence contains no duplicate element, $a_n\in\{a_i-1,a_j+1\}$, as needed.
\end{proof}

Since the sequence contains infinitely small and infinitely large elements, $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ is a contiguous interval whose minimum decreases indefinitely and whose maximum increases indefinitely, so every integer occurs in the sequence.
