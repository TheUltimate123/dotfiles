Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB\ne AC$. Let $H$ be the orthocenter of triangle $ABC$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Let $D$ be a point on side $AB$ and $E$ a point on side $AC$ such that $AE=AD$, and the points $D$, $H$, $E$ are on the same line. Prove that line $HM$ is perpendicular to the common chord of the circumscribed circles of triangle $ABC$ and triangle $ADE$.
