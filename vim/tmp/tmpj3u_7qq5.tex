You are given $n$ blocks each with weight at least 1 and total weight $2n$. Prove that for every real number $r\in[0,2n-2]$ there is a subset of the blocks whose total weight is between $r$ and $r+2$.

In what follows, $\opname{avg}S$ denotes the average of the elements of $S$, and $\opname{sum}S$ denotes the sum of the elements of $S$. We solve the problem in the (slightly stronger) form:
\begin{quote}
    Let $S$ be a multiset with $\opname{avg}S\le2$ and $\min S\ge1$. Then for all $r\in[0,\opname{sum}S]$, there is a subset $T\subseteq S$ such that $\opname{sum}T\in[r,r+2]$. Moreover, if $\opname{avg}S<2$, then we can find $T$ with $\opname{sum}T\in[r,r+2)$.
\end{quote}
Strong induct on $n$, with base case negligible.
First observe that the cases with $\opname{avg}S\ne2$ follow by scaling, so we only need to prove the $\opname{avg}S=2$ case.

Assume the hypothesis holds for all nonnegative integers less than $n$, but for contradiction there is a proper subset $T\subsetneq S$ such that no subset of $S$ has sum in the interval $(\opname{sum}T,\opname{sum}T+2]$. Let $\seg T=S-T$. It will suffice to derive a contradiction.
\begin{claim*}
    $\min\seg T\le\opname{sum}T+2$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    From the identity $0\le|T|\cdot(|S|-|T|-1)$, we have
    \begin{align*}
    2|T|\le|T|\cdot(|S|-|T|+1)&\le\opname{sum}T\cdot(|S|-|T|+1),\\
    \implies2|S|-\opname{sum}T&\le(|S|-|T|)\cdot(\opname{sum}T+2).
    \end{align*}
    Since $\opname{avg}S\le2$,
    \[\min\seg T\le\frac{2|S|-\opname{sum}T}{|S|-|T|}\le\opname{sum}T+2,\]
    as claimed.
\end{proof}

Finally if $\min\seg T\le2$, then $T\cup\{\min\seg T\}$ has sum in the interval, so we may assume $\min\seg T>2$. As such, $\opname{avg}T<2$, so by the inductive hypothesis, for every $r\in[0,\opname{sum}T]$ there is a subset $U\subseteq T$ such that $\opname{sum}U\in[r,r+2)$.

Let $U$ be one such subset for $r=\min\seg T-2$. Then
\[\left(S\cup\{\min\seg T\}\right)-U\]
has sum in the interval $(\opname{sum}T,\opname{sum}T+2]$. End proof.
