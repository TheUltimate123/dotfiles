Let $P$ be a point in the plane of $\triangle ABC$, and $\gamma$ a line passing through $P$. Let $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ be the points where the reflections of lines $PA$, $PB$, $PC$ with respect to $\gamma$ intersect lines $BC$, $AC$, $AB$ respectively. Prove that $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ are collinear.

Redefine $A'=\seg{BC}\cap\seg{B'C'}$. It suffices to show that $\gamma$ bisects $\angle APA'$. Apply DDIT on $BCB'C'$ from $P$, so that an involution swaps $(\seg{PB},\seg{PB'})$, $(\seg{PC},\seg{PC'})$, and finally $(\seg{PA},\seg{PA'})$. This involution is a reflection over $\gamma$, so we are done.
