Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers and let
\[T = \{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb N^3\mid1\le x,y,z\le n\}\]
be lattice cube of length $n$. Suppose that $3n^2-3n+1+k$ points of $T$ are colored red such that if $P$ and $Q$ are red points and $\seg{PQ}$ is parallel to one of the coordinate axes, then the whole segment $PQ$ consists of only red points.

Prove that there exist at least $k$ unit cubes of length $1$, all of whose vertices are colored red.

Consider the following binary matrices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $A$ be the $n\times n\times n$ matrix with $A_{ijk}=1$ whenever $(i,j,k)$ is red.
    \item Let $B$ be the $n\times n\times(n-1)$ matrix with $B_{ijk}=1$ whenever $A_{ijk}=A_{i,j,k+1}=1$.
    \item Let $C$ be the $n\times(n-1)\times(n-1)$ matrix with $C_{ijk}=1$ whenever $B_{ijk}=B_{i,j+1,k}=1$.
    \item Let $D$ be the $(n-1)\times(n-1)\times(n-1)$ matrix with $D_{ijk}=1$ whenever $C_{ijk}=C_{i+1,j,k}=1$.
\end{itemize}
