Let $n$ be an even positive integer, and let $G$ be an $n$-vertex simple graph with exactly $\tfrac{n^2}{4}$ edges. An unordered pair of distinct vertices $\{x,y\}$ is said to be \emph{amicable} if they have a common neighbor (i.e.\ there is a vertex $z$ such that $xz$ and $yz$ are both edges). Prove that $G$ has at least $2\tbinom{n/2}{2}$ amicable pairs of vertices.

Let $G$ have $E=\tfrac{n^2}4$ edges. For each $v\in G$, Let $N(v)$ be the set of vertices adjacent to $v$, so that $|N(v)|=\deg v$. The pith of this problem is this infamous paradox:
\begin{boxlemma*}[Friendship paradox: On average, your friends are more popular than you]
    If a vertex $v$ is chosen from $G$, then \[\mathbb E\left[\frac1{\deg v}\sum_{u\in N(v)}\deg u\right]\ge\mathbb E[\deg v],\]
    with equality if and only if the connected components of $G$ are regular.
\end{boxlemma*}
\begin{proof}
    The proof is by taking the sum over all $v$: \[\sum_{v\in G}\frac1{\deg v}\sum_{u\in N(v)}\deg u=\sum_{uv\in E}\left(\frac{\deg u}{\deg v}+\frac{\deg v}{\deg u}\right)\ge 2E=\sum_{v\in G}\deg v.\]
    Equality holds if and only if $\deg u=\deg v$ for all edges $uv$.
\end{proof}

We use a much weaker form of the lemma: on average, your most popular friend is more popular than you. This gives \[\sum_{v\in G}\left\lvert N^2(v)\right\rvert\ge\sum_{v\in G}\left(\max_{u\in N(v)}\deg u-1\right)\ge\sum_{v\in G}(\deg v-1)=2E-n=4\binom{n/2}2,\]
and we are done.
