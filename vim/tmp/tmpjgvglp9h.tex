Prove that there is a constant $c>0$ with the following property: If $a$, $b$, $n$ are positive integers such that $\gcd(a+i,b+j)>1$ for all $i,j\in\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, then \[\min\{a,b\}>c^n\cdot n^{n/2}.\]

---

To simplify computation, we only use $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We will prove the bound $\min\{a,b\}>n^{n/2}-n$ for sufficiently large $n$.

Consider the $n\times n$ grid defined by the points $(a+i,b+j)$, and note the following estimates:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item Each prime $p<n$ divides at most $(1+n/p)^2$ the cells of the grid.
    \item Each prime $p\ge n$ divdes at most one cell of the grid.
\end{itemize}
Let there be $T$ primes $p\ge n$ dividing some cell of the grid; then
\[
    T&\ge n^2-\sum_{p<n}\left(1+\frac np\right)
    =n^2-\pi(n)-2n\sum_{p<n}\frac1n-n^2\sum_{p<n}\frac1{p^2}
    >\frac{n^2}2
\]
for sufficiently large $n$.
\begin{remark}
    The estimate $T>\tfrac12n^2$ is obtained by the following:
    \begin{align*}
        \pi(n)&=\frac n{\log n}\left(1+O\left(\frac1{\log n}\right)\right)\\
        \sum_{p<n}\frac1p&=\log\log n\cdot(1+o(1))\\
        \sum_{p<n}\frac1{p^2}&<\sum_p\frac1{p^2}\approx0.452<\frac12.
    \end{align*}
\end{remark}
Hence \[(a+n)^n>(a+1)\cdots(a+n)>n^T>n^{n^2/2}\implies x>n^{n/2}-n,\]
The required bound follows.
