Let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma>0$ be angles such that $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=90^\circ$ and \[\tan\alpha\tan\beta\tan\gamma+\sec\alpha\sec\beta\sec\gamma=\frac{37}{20}.\]Then, the minimum possible value of $\cos \alpha$ can be expressed as $\tfrac mn,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers$.$ Find $m+n.$

First let $x=\tan\alpha$, $y=\tan\beta$, and $z=\tan\gamma$. We claim that $xy+yz+zx=1$. Notice that \[z=\tan\gamma=\tan(90-\alpha-\beta)=\frac{1-xy}{x+y},\]
and the desired result readily follows.

Now, since $\tan^2\theta+1=\sec^2\theta$, $\sec\alpha=\sqrt{x^2+1}$, and so on. It follows that \[xyz+\sqrt{(x^2+1)(y^2+1)(z^2+1)}=\frac{37}{20}.\]
However, if $i=\sqrt{-1}$ and $P(t)$ is the monic cubic with roots $x,y,z$,
\begin{align*}
    (x^2+1)(y^2+1)(z^2+1)&=P(i)P(-i)\\
    &=((x+y+z)-xyz)^2.
\end{align*}
We claim that $x+y+z\ge xyz$. Assume FTSoC that $x+y+z<xyz$. Then,
\begin{align*}
    x(yz-1)>y+z=(1-yz)\tan(\beta+\gamma)&=\frac1x(1-yz)\\
    \implies \left(x+\frac1x\right)(yz-1)&>0.
\end{align*}
Since $x>0$, $yz>1$. Similarly, $zx>1$ and $xy>1$. However, this implies that \[1=xy+yz+zx>3,\]
a contradiction. Now, we have that $x+y+z=\tfrac{37}{20}$, so \[x^2+y^2+z^2=(x+y+z)^2-2(xy+yz+zx)=\frac{569}{400}.\]
However, by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, \[2\left(\frac{569}{400}-x^2\right)=2(y^2+z^2)\ge (y+z)^2=\left(\frac{37}{20}-x\right)^2.\]
This solves to \[\frac{11}{60}\le x\le\frac{21}{20}.\]
Since $\cos\alpha$ is minimized when $\tan\alpha$ is maximized, take $x=\frac{21}{20}$ to get $\cos\alpha=\frac{20}{29}$, and the requested sum is $20+29=49$.
