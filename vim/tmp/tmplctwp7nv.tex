Find all polynomials $P,Q\in\mathbb Q[x]$ such that
\[P(x)^3+Q(x)^3\equiv x^{12}+1.\]

---

Observe that the factorizations
\begin{align*}
    x^{12}+1&=\left(x^4+1\right)\left(x^8-x^4+1\right)\\
    P^3+Q^3&=(P+Q)\left(P^2+Q^2-PQ\right).
\end{align*}
It can be verified that $x^{12}+1$ is fully factorized above. hence
\[\left\{P+Q,P^2+Q^2-PQ\right\}=\left\{k\left(x^4+1\right),k^{-1}\left(x^8-x^4+1\right)\right\}\]
for some constant $k$.

However $\deg(P^2+Q^2-PQ)=2\max\{\deg P,\deg Q\}>\deg(P+Q)$. (Note that if $\deg P=\deg Q$, then the leading coefficient of $P^2+Q^2-PQ$ is still positive.) Hence
\begin{align*}
    P+Q&=k\left(x^4+1\right)\\
    P^2+Q^2-PQ&=k^{-1}\left(x^8-x^4+1\right).
\end{align*}

\begin{claim*}
    $\deg P\ne\deg Q$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    Assume not, and let $p$, $q$ be the leading coefficients of $P$, $Q$. The leading coefficient $p^2+q^2-pq>0$ does not vanish in $P^2+Q^2-PQ$, so $\deg P=\deg Q=4$. Then by $P^3+Q^3=x^{12}+1$, we have
    \[p^3+q^3=1,\]
    which is impossible for rational $p$, $q$ by Fermat's last theorem.
\end{proof}

Then let $\deg P=4$ and $\deg Q<4$. so the leading coefficient of $P+Q$ is $p=k$, and the leading coefficient of $P^2+Q^2-PQ$ is $p^2=k^{-1}$; it follows that $p=k=1$. Hence
\begin{align*}
    P+Q&=x^4+1\\
    P^2+Q^2-PQ&=x^8-x^4+1.
\end{align*}
Then observe that
\[x^8-x^4+1=(P+Q)^2-3PQ=\left(x^8+2x^4+1\right)-3PQ,\]
hence $PQ=x^4$.

The only solution is $P(x)\equiv x^4$, $Q\equiv1$ (and its permutation), which works.
