Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$ be positive integers and let $S=a+b+c+d+e+f$.
Suppose that the number $S$ divides $abc+def$ and $ab+bc+ca-de-ef-df$. Prove that $S$ is composite.

We can verify by hand that
\[(X+a)(X+b)(X+c)\equiv(X-d)(X-e)(X-f)\pmod S\]
for all $X$.

By setting $X=d$, we have $S$ divides $(d+a)(d+b)(d+c)$.
But each of $d+a$, $d+b$, $d+c$ is less than $S$, so $S$ may not be prime.
