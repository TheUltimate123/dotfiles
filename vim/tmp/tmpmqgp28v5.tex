Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ and $\ell$ a line without common points with $\omega$. Denote by $P$ the foot of the perpendicular from the center of $\omega$ to $\ell$. The lines $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ intersect $\ell$ at the points $X$, $Y$, $Z$ different from $P$. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $AXP$, $BYP$, and $CZP$ have a common point different from $P$ or are mutually tangent at $P$.

Invert at $P$ to obtain the following problem: Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ and $P$ the foot from $O$ to line $\ell$. Show that if the circumcircles of $BPC$, $CPA$, $APB$ intersect $\ell$ again at $X$, $Y$, $Z$, respectively, then $\seg{AX}$, $\seg{BY}$, $\seg{CZ}$ concur. Let $\ell$ intersect the sides of the triangle at $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, respectively.
\begin{iclaim*}
    In terms of directed lengths, $PA'\cdot PX=PB'\cdot PY=PC'\cdot PZ$.
\end{iclaim*}
\begin{proof}
    Compute
    \begin{align*}
        PA'\cdot PX&=PA'(PA'+A'X)
        =PA'^2+PA'\cdot A'X\\
        &=PA'^2-\pow(A',(BCX))\\
        &=PA'^2-\pow(A',(ABC))\\
        &=PA'^2+R^2-OA^2
        =R^2-OP^2,
    \end{align*}
    which is constant.
\end{proof}

Now let $Q=\seg{BY}\cap\seg{CZ}$ and $X'=\seg{AQ}\cap\ell$. By DDIT on $BCZY$, an involution swaps $(\seg{AB},\seg{AZ})$, $(\seg{AC},\seg{AY})$, and $(\seg{AA'},\seg{AQ})$. Projecting onto $\ell$, an involution swaps $(C',Z)$, $(B',Y)$, and $(A',X')$. The center of this inversion is $P$, so this involution swaps $A'$ and $X$. Therefore $X=X'$, completing the proof.
