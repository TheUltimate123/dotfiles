Let $\mathcal P$ be a finite set of squares on an infinite chessboard. Kelvin the Frog notes that $\mathcal P$ may be tiled with only $1\times2$ dominoes, while Alex the Kat notes that $\mathcal P$ may be tiled with only $2\times1$ dominoes. The dominoes cannot be rotated in each tiling. Prove that the area of $\mathcal P$ is a multiple of $4$.

Color the infinite chessboard as follows:
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a&b&a&b&\cdots\\
        c&d&c&d&\cdots\\
        a&b&a&b&\cdots\\
        c&d&c&d&\cdots\\
        \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
Let $\mathcal P$ contain $A$ cells colored $a$, and similarly define $B$, $C$, $D$. That $\mathcal P$ may be tiled with horizontal dominos gives $A=B$, $C=D$, and that $\mathcal P$ may be tiled with vertical dominos gives $A=C$, $B=D$. Hence $A=B=C=D$, and so $A+B+C+D$ is a multiple of four.
