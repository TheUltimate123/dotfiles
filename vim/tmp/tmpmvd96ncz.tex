Let $P(X)$ be a monic polynomial with integer coefficients all of whose zeros lie on the unit circle. Show that all the zeros of $P(X)$ are roots of unity.

Let $\alpha_1$, \ldots, $\alpha_n$ be the roots of $P(X)$. Consider the sequence of polynomials
\[P_e(X)=(X-\alpha_1^e)\cdots(X-\alpha_n^e).\]
By the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, all $P_e(X)$ are integer polynomials.

However, each coefficient of $P_e(X)$ has absolute value bounded by $\binom n{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$, so there are finitely many possible polynomials in the sequence; this means $P(X)=P_e(X)$ for some $e>1$. Hence, $\{\alpha_1^e,\ldots,\alpha_n^e\}$ is a permutation of $\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\}$.

Keep applying this permutation until we find an $E$ such that $\alpha_1^E=\alpha_1$, \ldots, $\alpha_n^E=\alpha_n$. Thus all zeros of $P(X)$ are roots of unity, as desired.
