Let $a_0$ be a fixed positive integer. We define an infinite sequence of positive integers $\{a_n\}_{n\ge1}$ in an inductive way as follows: if we are given the terms $a_0$, $a_1$, \ldots $a_{n-1}$ , then $a_n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $\sqrt[n]{a_0a_1\cdots a_n}$ is a positive integer. Show that the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\ge1}$ is eventually constant.

Observe that $a_1=1$ always, so instead start our indexing at $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$.

For all primes $p$, note that $\nu_p(a_n)$ is the unique integer in the range $0\le a_n\le n-1$ for which
\[n\quad\text{divides}\quad a_1+\cdots+a_n.\]
By \href{https://aops.com/community/c6h145842p825490}{USAMO 2007/1}, the sequence $\nu_p(a_1)$, $\nu_p(a_2)$, $\ldots$ is eventually constant.

Hence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$ is eventually constant, which is what we needed to show.
