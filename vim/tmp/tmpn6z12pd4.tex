Let $ABC$ be a fixed triangle, and let $A_1$, $B_1$, $C_1$ be the midpoints of sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$, respectively. Let $P$ be a variable point on the circumcircle, and let lines $PA_1$, $PB_1$, $PC_1$ meet the circumcircle again at $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, respectively. Assume that the points $A$, $B$, $C$, $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ are distinct, and lines $AA'$, $BB'$, $CC'$ form a triangle. Prove that the area of this triangle does not depend on $P$.

Let this triangle be $XYZ$. By Pascal's theorem on $BB'PC'CA$, $X$ lies on $\seg{B_1C_1}$, so by Pappus' theorem on $BACZA_1Y$, $\seg{AX}$, $\seg{BY}$, $\seg{CZ}$ are parallel. Thus \[ [XYZ]=[XYA]+[XAZ]=[XBA]+[XAC]=\tfrac12[ABC],\]
which is constant.
