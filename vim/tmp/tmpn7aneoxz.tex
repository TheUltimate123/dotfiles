Consider a $m\times n$ rectangular board consisting of $mn$ unit squares. Two of its unit squares are called \emph{adjacent} if they have a common edge, and a path is a sequence of unit squares in which any two consecutive squares are adjacent. Two parths are called \emph{non-intersecting} if they don't share any common squares.

Each unit square of the rectangular board can be colored black or white. We speak of a \emph{coloring} of the board if all its $mn$ unit squares are colored.

Let $N$ be the number of colorings of the board such that there exists at least one black path from the left edge of the board to its right edge. Let $M$ be the number of colorings of the board for which there exist at least two non-intersecting black paths from the left edge of the board to its right edge.

Prove that $N^2\ge M\cdot2^{mn}$.
