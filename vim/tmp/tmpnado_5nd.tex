Given a triangle $ABC$, consider the semicircle with diameter $\overline{EF}$ on $\overline{BC}$ tangent to $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$. If $BE=1$, $EF=24$, and $FC=3$, find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$.

Let the semicircle have center $I$, and let it touch $\seg{AB}$ and $\seg{AC}$ at $P$ and $Q$ respectively. The first step is to determine $BP=5$ and $CQ=9$, which may be done by either Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle IBP$ and $\triangle ICQ$ or direct power of a point.

Since $IP=IQ$, we have by HL that $\triangle API\cong\triangle AQI$. Denote $x=AP=AQ$, and remark that $\seg{AI}$ bisects $\angle BAC$. By Angle Bisector theorem, \[\frac{x+5}{x+9}=\frac{BI}{IC}=\frac{13}{15}\implies x=21.\]
Summing the known lengths, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $84$.
