Prove that there are infinitely many distinct pairs $(a, b)$ of relatively prime integers $a>1$ and $b>1$ such that $a^b+b^a$ is divisible by $a+b$.

We claim that $(a,b)=(2k-1,2k+1)$ works for all $k>1$. Since $2k-1$ and $2k+1$ are both odd, \[\gcd(2k-1,2k+1)=\gcd(2k-1,2)=1.\]
Furthermore, $a+b=4k$ and
\begin{align*}
    a^b+b^a&\equiv(2k-1)^{2k+1}+(2k+1)^{2k-1}\\
    &\equiv 2k(2k+1)-1+2k(2k+1)+1\\
    &\equiv 0\pmod{4k},
\end{align*}
as required.
