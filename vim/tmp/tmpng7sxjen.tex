Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that the largest prime divisor of $n^4+n^2+1$ is equal to the largest prime divisor of $(n+1)^4+(n+1)^2+1$.

Let $f(n)=n^2+n+1$, and let $p(n)$ denote the largest prime divisor of $f(n)$. The key observation is that \[n^4+n^2+1=\left(n^2+n+1\right)\left(n^2-n+1\right)=f(n)f(n-1),\]
so we want to show $p(n)p(n-1)=p(n)p(n+1)$ for infinitely many $n$; it suffices, therefore, to prove $p(n)\ge\max(p(n-1),p(n+1))$ for infinitely many $n$.

Assume for contradiction otherwise. Then $p(n)$ is eventually strictly increasing (since integer sequences cannot be eventually strictly decreasing). This is absurd, since for each $n$ we have $f(n^2)=f(n)f(n-1)$ and thus $p(n^2)=\max(p(n),p(n-1))$.
