A circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin of the coordinate plane intersects the graph of $x^2+y=x+y^2$ at exactly two points. What is the maximum possible value of $r$?

The given curve rearranges to $(x-y)(x+y-1)=0$, so it is the union of the lines $y=x$ and $y=1-x$. Each circle intersects $y=x$ twice, and it intersects twice $y=1-x$ when $r>1/\sqrt2$. We can check $r=1/\sqrt2$ works.

$1/\sqrt2$
