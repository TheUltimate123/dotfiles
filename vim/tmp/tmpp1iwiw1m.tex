Alice and Bob play the following game. They alternate selecting distinct nonzero digits (from $1$ to $9$) until they have chosen seven such digits, and then consider the resulting seven-digit number (i.e.\ $\seg{A_1B_2A_3B_4A_5B_6A_7}$). Alice wins if and only if the resulting number is the last seven decimal digits of some perfect seventh power. Determine which player has the winning strategy.

Alice has the winning strategy. I claim that $x^7$ attains all residues relatively prime to $10^7$ (so as long as $A_7\in\{1,3,7,9\}$, Alice wins).

First note that there is a primitive root $g$ modulo $5^7$, so powers of $g$ attain every residue modulo $5^7$. Since $\vphi(5^7)=4\cdot5^6$ is not divisible by $7$, every residue modulo $5^7$ not divisible by $5$ is of the form $g^{7k}$ for some $k$.

Finally we show $x^7$ attains all odd residues modulo $2^7$; it suffices to show that if $a^7\equiv b^7\pmod{2^7}$ but $a\not\equiv b\pmod{2^7}$, then $a$ and $b$ are both even. If one of $a$ and $b$ is even, then so is the other, so assume for contradiction $a$ and $b$ are both odd. Then $2^7\mid(a-b)b^7\Psi_7(a/b)$, where $\Psi_7$ denotes $7$th cyclotomic polynomial. If $2\mid\Psi_7(a/b)$, then $\ord_2(a/b)=7$. This implies $2\equiv1\pmod7$, which is absurd. Thus $2^7\mid a-b$, the desired contradiction.
