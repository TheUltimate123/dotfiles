Find all irrational numbers $x$ such that $x^3-17x$ and $x^2+4x$ are both rational numbers.

Since $x^2+4x$ is rational, so is $(x+2)^2=x^2+4x$; let this be $q$, so that $x=-2\pm\sqrt q$. We then have \[\mathbb Q\ni x^3-17x=\left(-8\pm12\sqrt q-6q\pm q\sqrt q\right)+\left(34\mp17\sqrt q\right)=26-6q\pm(-5+q)\sqrt q\]
whence $q=5$. The end.

$2\pm\sqrt5$
