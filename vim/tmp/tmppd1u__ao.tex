Consider 2009 cards, each having one gold side and one black side, lying in parallel on a long
table. Initially all cards show their gold sides. Two players, standing by the same long side of
the table, play a game with alternating moves. Each move consists of choosing a block of 50
consecutive cards, the leftmost of which is showing gold, and turning them all over, so those
which showed gold now show black and vice versa. The last player who can make a legal move
wins.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),itemsep=0em]
    \item Does the game necessarily end?
    \item Does there exist a winning strategy for the starting player?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Solution to part (a)} Consider a binary string whose $i$th bit from the left is $1$ if the $i$th card from the left is gold and $0$ if the $i$th card from the left is black. Then the corresponding number strictly decreases, so the process must terminate.

\paragraph{Solution to part (b)} In fact the first player loses regardless of which moves are made. Label the cards $2008$, $2007$, $\ldots$, $0$, and consider the number of cards among $\{2000,1950,\ldots,0\}$ that are gold. This number is initially $40$ and its parity changes each move, so an even number of moves are made; i.e.\ the last player is the second player.
