We have $2^m$ sheets of paper, with the number $1$ written on each of them. We perform the following operation. In every step we choose two distinct sheets; if the numbers on the two sheets are $a$ and $b$, then we erase these numbers and write the number $a+b$ on both sheets. Prove that after $m2^{m-1}$ steps, the sum of the numbers on all the sheets is at least $4^m$.

At any given moment in time, let $P$ be the product of the numbers on the $2^m$ sheets of paper. Each time the operation is performed, $P$ increases by a factor of \[\frac{(a+b)^2}{ab}\ge4\]
by AM-GM. Hence after $m2^{m-1}$ moves, $P\ge4^{m2^{m-1}}$, and again by AM-GM, the sum $S$ of the numbers on all the sheets is given by \[\frac S{2^m}\ge\left(4^{m2^{m-1}}\right)^{2^{-m}}=2^m,\]
Thus $S\ge4^m$, as desired.
