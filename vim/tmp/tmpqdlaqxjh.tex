Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ for which all the prime divisors of $n^2+n+1$ are not more then $\sqrt n$.

Observe that
\[n^{4040}+n^{2020}+1=\left(n^2-n+1\right)\left(n^2+n+1\right)\left(\frac{n^{2020}-n^{1010}+1}{n^2-n+1}\right)\left(\frac{n^{2020}+n^{1010}+1}{n^2+n+1}\right).\]
Each term is less than $n^{2020}$ for large $n$, so we are done.
