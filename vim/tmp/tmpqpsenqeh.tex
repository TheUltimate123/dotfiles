What is the smallest positive integer $t$ such that we can find integers $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_t$ with \[x_1^3+x_2^3+\cdots+x_t^3=2002^{2002}?\]

---

The answer is $4$, which works since \[2002^{2002}=2002^{2001}\left(10^3+10^3+1^3+1^3\right).\]
Note that if $x$ is an integer, then $x^3$ is $\{0,1,-1\}\pmod9$. However $2002^{2002}\equiv4\pmod9$, so $t\ge4$.
