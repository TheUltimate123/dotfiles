Let $A$ be a set with $|A|=225$, meaning that $A$ has 225 elements. Suppose further that there are eleven subsets $A_1$, $\ldots$, $A_{11}$ of $A$ such that $|A_i|=45$ for $1\le i\le11$ and $|A_i\cap A_j|=9$ for $1\le i<j\le11$. Prove that $|A_1\cup A_2\cup\ldots\cup A_{11}|\ge165$, and give an example for which equality holds.

Say that $A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_{11}=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ for some $n$. We count the number of $(i,j,k)$ such that $k\in A_i\cap A_j$ in two ways. First, since $|A_i\cap A_j|=9$ for all $i,j$, the number of such triples is $9\cdot\binom{11}2=495$. Now, if $\deg k$ denotes the number of $i$ such that $k\in A_i$, by Jensen's Inequality, \[495=\sum_{k=1}^n\binom{\deg k}n\ge n\binom{495/n}2=\frac{495}2\left(\frac{495}n-1\right),\]
thus $n\ge165$, as desired. To achieve equality, take any permutation of the $\binom{11}3=165$ subsets of $\{1,\ldots,11\}$ with cardinality $3$, and say that $k\in A_i$ if $i$ is in the $k$th subset.
