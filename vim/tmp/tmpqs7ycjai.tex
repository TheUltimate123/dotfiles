For a positive integer $n>2$, consider the $n-1$ fractions
\[\dfrac21,\;\dfrac32,\;\ldots,\;\frac n{n-1}.\]
The product of these fractions equals $n$, but if you reciprocate (i.e.\ turn upside down) some of the fractions, the product will change. Find all $n$ for which you can make the product equal 1.

The answer is perfect squares; achieved by
\[\left(\frac21\cdot\frac32\cdots\frac{\sqrt n}{\sqrt n-1}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{\sqrt n}{\sqrt n+1}\cdot\frac{\sqrt n+1}{\sqrt n+2}\cdots\frac{n-1}n\right)=1.\]
Observe that whenever we reciprocate a fraction $p/q$, the product changes by a factor of $(q/p)^2$; hence at any point in time, the product is $nr^2$ for some rational number $r$. Finally $nr^2$ can equal 1 only if $n$ is a perfect square.
