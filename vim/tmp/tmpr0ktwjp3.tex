For distinct complex numbers $z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_{673}$, the polynomial \[(x-z_1)^3(x-z_2)^3\cdots(x-z_{673})^3\]
can be expressed as $x^{2019}+20x^{2018}+19x^{2017}+g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients and with degree at most $2016$. The value of \[\left|\sum_{1\le j<k\le 673}z_jz_k\right|\]
can be  expressed in the form $\tfrac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Let $x=\sum_{1\le j<k\le 673} z_jz_k$. By Vieta's, \[3\sum_{i=1}^{673}z_i=-20\implies \sum_{i=1}^{673}z_i=-\frac{20}3.\]
Then, consider the $19x^{2017}$ term. To produce the product of two roots, the two roots can either be either $(z_i,z_i)$ for some $i$, or $(z_j,z_k)$ for some $j<k$. In the former case, this can happen in $\tbinom 32=3$ ways, and in the latter case, this can happen in $3^2=9$ ways. Hence,
\begin{align*}
    19=3\sum_{i=1}^{673} z_i^2+9\sum_{1\le j<k\le 673} z_jz_k=3\left(\left(-\frac{20}3\right)^2-2x\right)+9x&=\frac{400}3+3x\\
    \implies x&=-\frac{343}9,
\end{align*}
and the requested sum is $343+9=352$.
