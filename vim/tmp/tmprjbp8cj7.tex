A strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ has the property that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic. Suppose that $a_{13} = 2016$. Find $a_1$.

First let $a_1=a$ and $a_2=t$. Then, we claim that for all $k$,
\begin{align*}
    a_{2k-1}&=a((k-1)t-(k-2))^2,\text{ and}\\
    a_{2k}&=a((k-1)t-(k-2))(kt-(k-1)).
\end{align*}
This is trivial by induction. Then, if $b=a_2=at$, $\frac{(6b-5a)^2}a=2016$, so $2^53^27a$ is a perfect square. It follows that we can write $a=14c^2$. Then, $$6b-70c^2=168c\implies 3b=35c^2+84c.$$
Then, $3\mid c$. Clearly, if $c\ge 9$, then $b>2016$, a contradiction. Test that $c=6$ doesn't work. Thus, $c=3$, and $a=504$.
