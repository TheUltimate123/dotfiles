Let $n$ be a positive integer. Prove that there exist polynomials $P$ and $Q$ with real coefficients such that for every real number $x$, we have $P(x)\ge0$, $Q(x)\ge0$, and \[1-x^n=(1-x)P(x)+(1+x)Q(x).\]

---

For $n$ odd, take \[P(x)=\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}\quad\text{and}\quad Q(x)=0.\]
For $n$ even, take \[P(x)=\frac{(1+x)^2}2\cdot\frac{1-x^n}{1-x^2}\quad\text{and}\quad Q(x)=\frac{(1-x)^2}2\cdot\frac{1-x^n}{1-x^2}.\]
