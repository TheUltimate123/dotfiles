Determine the largest real number $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$, $y$, $z$, \[\left(x^2+1\right)\left(y^2+1\right)\left(z^2+1\right)\ge C(x+y+z)^2.\]

The answer is $3/4$, with equality achieved at $x=y=z=1/\sqrt2$. We present two solutions proving the lower bound.

\paragraph{First solution} It is clear we may assume without loss of generality $(x^2-1/2)(y^2-1/2)\ge0$. Hence \[\left(x^2-1/2\right)\left(y^2-1/2\right)\ge0\iff x^2y^2-\frac{x^2}2-\frac{y^2}2+\frac14\ge0\iff\left(x^2+1\right)\left(y^2+1\right)\ge\frac32x^2+\frac32y^2+\frac34.\]
