Let $p$ be a prime number and $f$ an integer polynomial of degree $d$ such that $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$ and $f(n)$ is congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $p$ for every integer $n$. Prove that $d\ge p-1$.

Recall that for every $k\le p-2$,
\[1^k+2^k+\cdots+(p-1)^k\equiv0\pmod p.\]
Hence if $\deg P\le p-2$, we have
\[f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(p-1)\equiv0\pmod p.\]
This is only possible if $f(0)\equiv f(1)\equiv\cdots\equiv f(p-1)\pmod p$, absurd.
