Let $n\ge2$ be a positive integer with divisors $1=d_1<d_2<\cdots<d_k=n$. Prove that $d_1d_2+d_2d_3+\cdots+d_{k-1}d_k$ is always less than $n^2$, and determine when it is a divisor of $n^2$.

The answer is $n$ prime, for which $k=2$ and $d_1d_2=n\mid n^2$. I claim no other integers work.

Assume $n$ is composite ($k>2$), and let $p$ be its smallest prime factor. Note that
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}d_id_{i+1}&>d_{k-1}d_k=\frac{n^2}p,\\
    \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}d_id_{i+1}&=\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\frac{n^2}{d_id_{i+1}}\le\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\frac{n^2}{i(i+1)}=n^2\cdot\frac{k-1}k<n^2.
\end{align*}
In summary, $d_1d_2+\cdots+d_{k-1}d_k$ is greater than $n^2/p$ and less than $n^2$, so it is less than $n^2$ but does not divide $n^2$.
