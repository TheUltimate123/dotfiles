Determine all pairs $(m,n)$ of distinct positive integers such that there exists a positive integer $s$ for which the number of divisors of $sm$ and of $sn$ are equal.

---

If $m$ divides $n$ or $n$ divides $m$, obviously no such $s$ exists. Otherwise, I claim the problem is true. To begin, set
\begin{align*}
    m&=z\cdot p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k}\cdot q_1^{e_1'}q_2^{e_2'}\cdots q_k^{e_\ell'}\\
    n&=z\cdot p_1^{f_1}p_2^{f_2}\cdots p_k^{f_k}\cdot q_1^{f_1'}q_2^{f_2'}\cdots q_k^{f_\ell'},
\end{align*}
so that $e_i<f_i$ and $e_i'>f_i'$ for all $i$. By our assumption, $k,\ell\ge1$. The extra term $z$ consists of all primes with the same exponent in $m$ and $n$, which we may ignore.

The goal is to find positive integers $x_1$, $x_2$, \ldots, $x_k$, $y_1$, $y_2$, \ldots, $y_\ell$ such that
\[\prod_{i=1}^k\frac{e_i+x_i}{f_i+x_i}\cdot\prod_{i=1}^\ell\frac{e_i'+y_i}{f_i'+y_i}=1.\]
Then take
\[s=p_1^{x_1-1}p_2^{x_2-1}\cdots p_k^{x_k-1}\cdot q_1^{y_1-1}q_2^{y_2-1}\cdots q_\ell^{y_\ell-1}\]
to win.

First, a claim:
\begin{claim*}
    For fixed $e<f$, for sufficiently large $T$ we can find a positive integer $x$ such that
    \[\frac{e+x}{f+x}=\frac T{T+1}.\]
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    Just let $x=T(f-e)-e$, which is positive for large $T$.
\end{proof}

Now select large $T$, and let
\[\frac{e_i+x_i}{f_i+x_i}=\frac{kT+i-1}{kT+i}\quad\text{and}\quad\frac{f_i'+y_i}{e_i'+y_i}=\frac{\ell T+i-1}{\ell T+i}\]
for all $i$. Then the products telescope to
\[\prod_{i=1}^k\frac{e_i+x_i}{f_i+x_i}\cdot\prod_{i=1}^\ell\frac{e_i'+y_i}{f_i'+y_i}=\frac{kT}{kT+k}\cdot\frac{\ell T+\ell}{\ell T}=1.\]
