There exists a unique positive real number $x$ satisfying\[x=\sqrt{x^2+\frac1{x^2}}-\sqrt{x^2-\frac1{x^2}}.\]Given that $x$ can be written as $x=2^{m/n}\cdot3^{-p/q}$ for positive integers $m$, $n$, $p$, $q$, with $\gcd(m,n)=\gcd(p,q)=1$, find $m+n+p+q$.

The equation in its given form reveals nothing about $x$, so we square it: \[x^2=2x^2-2\sqrt{x^4-\frac1{x^4}}\implies x^2=2\sqrt{x^4-\frac1{x^4}}.\]
Square it again to eliminate the radical: we obtain \[x^4=4\left(x^4-\frac1{x^4}\right)\implies3x^4=\frac4{x^4}\implies x^8=\frac43.\]
It follows that $x=2^{1/4}\cdot3^{-1/8}$, and the requested sum is $1+4+1+8=14$.
