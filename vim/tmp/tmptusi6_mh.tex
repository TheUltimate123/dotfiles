Let $S$ be a subset of positive integers with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),itemsep=0em]
    \item the numbers $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$ are elements of $S$; and
    \item for all distinct elements $a$ and $b$ in $S$, $ab$ is also in $S$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $K$ be the sum of the reciprocals of all the elements of $S$. What is the minimum possible value of $K$?

The minimal set $S$ by inclusion only contains numbers with prime factors within $\{2,3,5\}$. Since $4$, $6$, $10$ are in $S$ and we may repeatedly multiply by $2$, $3$, $5$, any even number with prime factors in $\{2,3,5\}$ must be an element of $S$. Furthermore $15\in S$, and repeatedly multiplying by $3$, $5$ we have any number with both $3$, $5$ as prime factors is an element of $S$.

In conclusion, $S$ contains numbers with prime factors within $\{2,3,5\}$, except $3^i$, $i\ge2$ and $5^i$, $i\ge2$. The answer is \[\left(1+\frac12+\frac1{2^2}+\cdots\right)\left(1+\frac13+\frac1{3^2}+\cdots\right)\left(1+\frac15+\frac1{5^2}+\cdots\right)-\left(\frac1{3^2}+\frac1{3^3}+\cdots\right)-\left(\frac1{5^2}+\frac1{5^3}+\cdots\right)=\frac{53}{15}.\]

$\frac{53}{15}$
