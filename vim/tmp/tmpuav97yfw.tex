Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. If $a^n+n$ divides $b^n+n$ for every positive integer $n$, prove that $a=b$.

We will prove $a\equiv b\pmod p$ for every prime $p\nmid b-a$, which will imply the result.

Indeed, for each such $p$, take an $n$ with $n\equiv1\pmod{p-1}$ and $n\equiv-a\pmod p$, so $k^n\equiv k\pmod p$ for all $k$. Then it follows that $p\mid a^n+n\mid b^n+n$, so $b\equiv-n\equiv a\pmod p$, as claimed
