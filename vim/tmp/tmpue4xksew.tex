Let $n$ be a positive integer. Determine the number of sequences of real numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ such that \[a_{k+1}^2=a_k^2+a_k-1\]
for all $k$ (with indices modulo $n$).

The answer is $\boxed2$. I claim that only $a_1=1$ and $a_1=-1$ work. Sum both sides to obtain \[\sum_{k=1}^na_{k+1}=\sum_{k=1}^n \left(a_k^2+a_k-1\right)\implies\sum_{k=1}^na_k^2=n.\]
Rewrite each term as $a_{k+1}+1=a_k(a_k+1)$, and multiply to obtain \[\prod_{k=1}^n (a_{k+1}+1)=\prod_{k=1}^na_k(a_k+1)\implies \prod_{k=1}^na_k=1\text{ or }a_k=-1.\]
If $a_k=-1$ for some $k$, then the sequence is constant at $-1$. Otherwise, by AM-GM, \[1=\frac1n\sum_{k=1}^na_k^2\ge\prod_{k=1}^na_k=1,\]
so we are in the equality case, and $a_k=\pm 1$, which implies that the sequence is all $1$, as desired.
