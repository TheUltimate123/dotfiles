Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the infinite sequence \[a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n-1,\ n\ge 1.\]

The answer is all positive integers whose prime factorization contains only $2$ and $3$; these obvious work. Say that $n$ is divisible by a prime $p\ge5$. Then by Fermat's Little Theorem, \[2^{p-2}+3^{p-2}+6^{p-2}\equiv 2^{-1}+3^{-1}+6^{-1}\equiv1\pmod p,\]
so taking $n=p-2$ gives $n$ not relatively prime to $a_n$.
