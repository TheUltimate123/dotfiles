Find all pairs of integers $a,b$ for which there exists a polynomial $P(x)\in\mathbb Z[X]$ such that product $(x^2+ax+b)\cdot P(x)$ is a polynomial of a form \[x^n+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+c_1x+c_0 \]
where each of $c_0,c_1,\ldots,c_{n-1}$ is equal to $1$ or $-1$.

The answers are $(0,\pm1)$, $(\pm1,\pm1)$, $(\mp1,\pm1)$, and $(\pm2,1)$. First notice that if $x^2+ax+b$ has a root of magnitude at least $2$, then it is impossible for $(x^2+ax+b)\cdot P(x)$ to have coefficients all with magnitude $1$.

By plugging in $x=0$, $b$ divides $c_0$, so $|b|=1$. Now if $|a|\ge3$, $x^2+ax+b$ has a root equal in magnitude to $\frac12(a\pm\sqrt{a^2\pm4})$, one of which has magnitude at least $2$. Furthermore $x^2+2x-1$ and $x^2-2x-1$ have roots $-1-\sqrt2$ and $1+\sqrt2$ respectively, contradiction.

To finish, it suffices to construct the claimed answers: $(x^2-1)(x+1)$ and $(x^2+1)(x-1)$ are valid, all $(\pm1,\pm1)$ and $(\pm1,\mp1)$ are already valid, and $(x^2-2x+1)(x+1)$ and $(x^2+2x+1)(x-1)$ are valid, the end.
