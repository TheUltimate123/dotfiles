Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $AB=AC$ and $\angle BAC=20^\circ$. Point $D$ is on side $AC$ such that $\angle CBD 50^\circ$. Point $E$ is on side $AB$ such that $\angle BCE=60^\circ$. Find the measure of $\angle CED$.

Here is a solution by Kaiwen Li. Denote by $D'$ the reflection of $D$ over $\overline{AB}$, and note that $\triangle BDD'$ is equilateral. Because $D'DCB$ is a kite, $\overline{CD'}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{BD}$, so $\angle ECD'=\angle ECD=20^\circ$ and $MCDE$ is cyclic (the latter following by the incenter-excenter lemma); hence, $\angle DEC=\angle DD'C=30^\circ$, and we're done.
