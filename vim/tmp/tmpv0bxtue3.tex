Find the greatest positive integer $E$ such that there is an edge-colored graph with $60$ vertices and $E$ edges with each edge colored either red or blue such that there is no monochromatic cycle of length either $3$ or $5$.

The answer is $1350$. To achieve this, partition the vertex set into $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ of $15$ vertices each; draw an red edge between any two vertices belonging to $(A,B)$, $(B,C)$, $(C,D)$, $(D,A)$, and blue between vertices belonging to $(A,C)$, $(B,D)$.

For maximality, it is not hard to check there is no $K_5$, so by Turan's theorem, \[E\le\left(1-\frac14\right)\frac{n^2}2=1350,\]
as desired.
