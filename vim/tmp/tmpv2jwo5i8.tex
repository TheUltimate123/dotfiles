Consider the sum \[S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac1{\sqrt{2k-1}}.\]
Determine the greatest integer less than or equal to $S_{4901}$.

Notice that
\begin{align*}
    \frac1{\sqrt k}=\frac2{2\sqrt k}>\frac2{\sqrt{k+2}+\sqrt k}&=\sqrt{k+2}-\sqrt k,
    \frac1{\sqrt{k+2}}=\frac2{2\sqrt{k+2}}<\frac2{\sqrt{k+2}+\sqrt k}&=\sqrt{k+2}-\sqrt k.\\
\end{align*}
Summing the first over odd $k$ from $1$ to $2n-1$ gives $S_n>\sqrt{2n+1}-1$ and summing the second over odd $k$ from $1$ to $2n-3$ gives $S_n-1<\sqrt{2n-1}-1$. Thus we conclude \[\sqrt{2n+1}-1<S_n<\sqrt{2n-1}.\]
With $n=4901$, we have $98<S_{4901}<99$, so the answer is $48$.
