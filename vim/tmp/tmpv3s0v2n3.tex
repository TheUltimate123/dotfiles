There are exactly $77,000$ ordered quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ such that $\gcd(a,b,c,d)=77$ and $\text{lcm}(a,b,c,d)=n$. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?

$\ans{13,860}{20,790}{21,560}{27,720}{41,580}$

Consider each prime factor $p_i$ of $\frac{n}{77}$, and suppose its exponent is $e_i$. Notice that the number of ways to distribute the primes is independent of the distribution of the other primes, so we consider $p_i$ separately.

We will count the number of $(w,x,y,z)$ such that $\min(w,x,y,z)=0$ and $\max(w,x,y,z)=e_i$ by PIE. There are $(e_i+1)^4$ quadruples $(w,x,y,z)\in(\mathbb{Z}\cap[0,e_i])^4$. But, $e_i^4$ of them do not contain $0$ and $e_i^4$ of them do not contain $e_i$, and $(e_i-1)^4$ of them do contain neither $0$ nor $e_i$. Then, the desired number of ways is \[(e_i+1)^4-2e_i^4+(e_i-1)^4=12e_i^2+2=2(6e_i^2+1).\]
Then, if $\frac{n}{77}=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, \[77,000=2^k\prod_{i=1}^k(6e_i^2+1).\]
Since $6e_i^2+1$ is odd and $\nu_2(77,000)=3$, $k=3$. Then, \[9625=\prod_{i=1}^3(6e_i^2+1).\]
The divisors of $9625$ are $1,5,7,11,25,35,55,77,125,175,275,385,875,1375,1925,9625$. Only $7,25,55,385$ can be expressed as $6e_i^2+1$ for positive $e_i$, and the only three of them that multiply to $9625$ are $7,25,55$. Then, $\{e_1,e_2,e_3\}=\{1,2,3\}$, and the smallest $n$ is $2^33^25^1\cdot 77=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }27,720}$.
