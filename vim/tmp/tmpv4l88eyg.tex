Consider a $6\times6$ grid. Define a \emph{diagonal} to be the six squares whose coordinates $(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,6\}^2$ satisfy $i-j\equiv k\pmod6$ for some $k=0,1,\ldots,5$. Hence there are six diagonals.

Determine if it is possible to fill it with the numbers $1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $36$ (each exactly once) such that each row, each column, and each of the six diagonals has the same sum.

The answer is no. Clearly each row, column, and diagonal has a sum of $111$.

Label the cells of the grid as follows: \[\begin{bmatrix}
    A&B&A&B&A&B\\
    D&C&D&C&D&C\\
    A&B&A&B&A&B\\
    D&C&D&C&D&C\\
    A&B&A&B&A&B\\
    D&C&D&C&D&C
\end{bmatrix}.\]
Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ denote the sum of the cells labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, respectively. Then we can verify $a+b=333$, $b+c=333$, $c+d=333$, $d+a=333$, $a+c=333$, $b+d=333$. Hence $a=b=c=d$, contradiction.
