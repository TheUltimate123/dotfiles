Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$ a point on segment $BC$. Let $X$ be a point inside segment $BD$ and let $Y$ be the point of intersection of line $AX$ with circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. Let $P$ be the second point of intersection of circumcircles of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DXY$. Show that $P$ is independent of the choice of $X$.

Here are two short solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\measuredangle AYP=\measuredangle XYP=\measuredangle XDP=\measuredangle BDP$, which is fixed.
\item Let $\overline{DP}$ intersect $(ABC)$ again at $Z$. By Reim's theorem $\overline{AZ}\parallel\overline{BC}$, so $Z$ is fixed, meaning $P$ is fixed.
\end{itemize}
