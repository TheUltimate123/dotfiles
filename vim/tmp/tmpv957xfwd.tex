Let $\mathcal S$ be a set of $16$ points in the plane, no three collinear. Let $\chi(\mathcal S)$ denote the number of ways to draw $8$ line segments with endpoints in $\mathcal S$, such that no two drawn segments intersect, even at endpoints. Find the smallest possible value of $\chi(\mathcal S)$ across all such $\mathcal S$.

The answer is $1430$. Let $C_n$ denote the minimum possible value of $\chi(S)$ when there are $2n$ points.

\begin{boxclaim}
    $C_n$ and $\chi(\mathcal S)$ are related as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(i)] $\chi(\mathcal S)\ge C_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}C_kC_{n-1-k}$.
        \item[(ii)] $\chi(\mathcal S)=C_n$ when $\mathcal S$ is a convex $2n$-gon.
    \end{itemize}
\end{boxclaim}
\begin{proof}
    Let $A$ be a point on the convex hull of $\mathcal S$, and let $B$ be the other endpoint of the segment incident to $A$. Suppose that line $AB$ splits the plane into two half-planes containing $k$ and $n-1-k$ points respectively.

    If $k$ is odd, then there are clearly at least $C_kC_{n-1-k}$ ways to draw the segments, so $$\chi(\mathcal S)\ge\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}C_kC_{n-1-k},$$
    as requested. Equality occurs when $\mathcal S$ is a convex $2n$-gon, as nothing can cross segment $AB$ and $\overline{AB}$ splits $\mathcal S$ into two convex sets.
\end{proof}

Since $C_0=C_1=1$, $C_n$ is the $n^\text{th}$ Catalan number, so $C_8=\tfrac19\binom{16}8=1430$, the answer.
