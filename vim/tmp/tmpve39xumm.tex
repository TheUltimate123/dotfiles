In the coordinate plane consider the set $S$ of all points with integer coordinates. For a positive integer $k$, two distinct points $A,B\in S$ will be called \emph{$k$-friends} if there is a point $C\in S$ such that the area of the triangle $ABC$ is equal to $k$. A set $T\subset S$ will be called \emph{$k$-clique} if every two points in $T$ are $k$-friends. Find the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a $k$-clique with more than 200 elements.

First, we characterize all $k$-friends:
\begin{claim*}
    $(a_1,b_1)$, $(a_2,b_2)$ are $k$-friends if and only if $\gcd(a_2-a_1,b_2-b_1)\mid2k$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    By translation, it is equivalent to show $(0,0)$, $(a,b)$ are $k$-friends if and only if $\gcd(a,b)\mid2k$. By Shoelace formula, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(a,b)$, $(x,y)$ should be $\pm2k=bx-ay$, so the claim follows from B\'ezout.
\end{proof}

What remains is as follows: select 200 points $(a_1,b_1)$, \ldots, $(a_{200},b_{200})$, and minimize \[2k:=\mathop{\lcm}_{i,j}\big\{\gcd(a_i-a_j,b_i-b_j)\big\}.\]
By Pigeonhole, for each $n=1,\ldots,14$ we have $n\mid\gcd(a_i-a_j,b_i-b_j)$ for some $i$, $j$; thus \[k\ge\frac{\lcm(1,\ldots,14)}2=180180.\]
Finally, 180180 is attainable by taking $\{(i,j):0\le i,j\le14\}$, so we are done.
