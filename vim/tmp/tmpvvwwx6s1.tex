Prove that there exists a real constant $c$ such that for any pair $(x,y)$ of real numbers, there exist relatively prime integers $m$ and $n$ satisfying the relation \[\sqrt{(x-m)^2+(y-n)^2}<c\log\left(x^2+y^2+2\right).\]

It is evident the following bound suffices.
\begin{claim*}
    For all $c>0$, there is an $N$ with the following property: there do not exist integers $x,y>N$ and $k>c\log x$ such that $\gcd(x+i,y+j)>1$ for positive integers $i,j<k$.
\end{claim*}
Consider the $k\times k$ grid defined by the points $(x+i,y+j)$, and note the following estimates:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item Each prime $p<k$ divides at most $(1+k/p)^2$ the cells of the grid.
    \item Each prime $p\ge k$ divdes at most one cell of the grid.
\end{itemize}
Let there be $T$ primes $p\ge k$ dividing some cell of the grid; then
\[
    T&\ge k^2-\sum_{p<k}\left(1+\frac kp\right)
    =k^2-\pi(k)-2k\sum_{p<k}\frac1k-k^2\sum_{p<k}\frac1{p^2}
    >\frac{k^2}2
\]
for sufficiently large $k$.
\begin{remark}
    The estimate $T>\tfrac12k^2$ is obtained by the following:
    \begin{align*}
        \pi(k)&=\frac k{\log k}\left(1+O\left(\frac1{\log k}\right)\right)\\
        \sum_{p<k}\frac1p&=\log\log k\cdot(1+o(1))\\
        \sum_{p<k}\frac1{p^2}&<\sum_p\frac1{p^2}\approx0.452<\frac12.
    \end{align*}
\end{remark}
Hence \[(x+k)^k>(x+1)\cdots(x+k)>k^T>k^{k^2/2}\implies x>k^{k/2}-k>\left(e^c\right)^k,\]
again, for sufficiently large $k$. The required bound follows.
