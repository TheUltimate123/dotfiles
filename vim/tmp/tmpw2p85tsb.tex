Find all prime numbers $p$ such that $3^p+5^p-1$ is a prime number.

The answer is $p=3$ only; evidently $p=3$ is the minimal $p$ that works. Henceforth assume $p\ge5$. I contend $3^p+5^p-1\equiv0\pmod7$. Indeed:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item If $p\equiv1\pmod6$, then $3^p+5^p-1\equiv3+5-1\equiv0\pmod7$ by Fermat's little theorem.
    \item If $p\equiv5\pmod6$, then $3^p+5^p-1\equiv3^{-1}+5^{-1}-1\equiv5+3-1\equiv0\pmod7$, also by Fermat's little theorem.
\end{itemize}
