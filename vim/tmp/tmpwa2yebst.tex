Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2+13$ is divisible by $2n-1$.

---

\begin{customenv}{First solution}
    Since $2n-1$ is odd, the problem is equivalent to \[2n-1\mid 4(n^2+13)=4n^2+52=(2n-1)(2n+1)+53,\]
    whence $2n-1\mid 53$. It follows that $2n-1=1$ or $2n-1=53$, which yield $n=1$ and $n=27$, respectively. The requested sum is $1+27=28$.
\end{customenv}
\begin{customenv}{Second solution}
    Note that $n=1$ works. However, for all $n>1$, it is possible for $2n-1$ to divide $n^2+13$ only if they are not relatively prime. By the Euclidean Algorithm, \[\gcd(n^2+13,2n-1)=\gcd(2n^2+26,2n-1)=\gcd(n+26,2n-1)=\gcd(n+26,53).\]
    It follows that $53\mid n+26$, so $n=53k-26$. However, $2n-1\mid n^2+13$ only if \[2n-1=\gcd(n^2+13,2n-1)=\gcd(n+26,53)\le 53,\]
    or $n\le 27$. Thus, the only valid $n$ of the form $53k-26$ occurs when $k=1$, or $n=27$. Consequently the requested sum is $1+27=28$.
