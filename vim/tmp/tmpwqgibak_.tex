A triangle is \emph{Pythagorean} if it is similar to a right triangle with integer side lengths. Find all integers $n\ge3$ for which it is possible to dissect a regular $n$-gon into Pythagorean triples.

---

The answer is $n=4$. To see this is possible, use two right triangles with sides $3$, $4$, $5$ to form a $3\times4$ rectangle, then stack this $4$ times along the direction of the side of length $3$ and $3$ times along the direction of the side of length $4$ to form a $12\times12$ square.

We now show this is the only possible $n$. Call an angle $\theta$ \emph{sensible} if $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$ are both rational. Thus all angles of a Pythagorean triangle are sensible.
\begin{iclaim*}
    If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are sensible, then so is $\alpha+\beta$.
\end{iclaim*}
\begin{proof}
    This is just by the addition formulas:
    \begin{align*}
        \cos(\alpha+\beta)&=\cos\alpha\cos\beta-\sin\alpha\sin\beta\in\mathbb Q,\\
        \sin(\alpha+\beta)&=\sin\alpha\cos\beta+\cos\alpha\sin\beta\in\mathbb Q,
    \end{align*}
    as desired.
\end{proof}

If such a dissection exists, each angle of the $n$-gon is split into sensible angles, so each interior angle of the $n$-gon is sensible. It follows that $\tfrac{2\pi}n$ is sensible. By Niven's theorem, $\cos\tfrac{2\pi}n\in\mathbb Q$ implies $n\in\{3,4,6\}$, and only for $n=4$ is $\sin\tfrac{2\pi}n\in\mathbb Q$.
