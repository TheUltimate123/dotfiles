Find \[\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{\frac{2000000}{4^k}}}2\right\rfloor,\]
where $\lfloor x\rfloor$  denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $x$.

The $k$th term counts the number of positive integers $x$ such that $4^k(2x-1)^2\le2\cdot10^6$. Summing over all $k$, we want the number of solutions $(k,x)$, where $k\ge0$ and $x\ge1$ are integers, such that $4^k(2x-1)^2\le2\cdot10^6$.

The left-hand side is always the square of $2^k(2x-1)$, and each positive integer can be uniquely expressed as a product of a power of $2$ and an odd integer. Thus the answer is $\left\lfloor10^3\sqrt2\right\rfloor=1414$.
