Let $a_0<a_1<a_2<\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Prove that there exists a unique integer $n\ge1$ such that
\[a_n<\frac{a_0+a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n}n\le a_{n+1}.\]

---

Instead consider the sequence \[b_n:=na_n-(a_0+\cdots+a_n).\]
which is strictly increasing. Then we want $b_n<0\le b_{n+1}$, which is unique.
