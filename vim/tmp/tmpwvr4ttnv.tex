The altitudes from $A$, $B$, $C$ of an acute triangle $ABC$ meet the opposite sides at $D$, $E$, $F$, respectively. The line through $D$ parallel to $\seg{EF}$ meets lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $Q$ and $R$, respectively. Lines $EF$ and $BC$ meet at $P$. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle $PQR$ passes through the midpoint of $\seg{BC}$.

By Reim's, $B$, $C$, $Q$, $R$ concyclic. Then $DE\cdot DF=DB\cdot DC=DP\cdot DM$ by $-1=(BC;DP)$.
