The diagonals of a trapezoid $ABCD$ intersect at point $P$. Point $Q$ lies between the parallel lines $BC$ and $AD$ such that $\angle AQD=\angle CQB$, and line $CD$ separates points $P$ and $Q$. Prove that $\angle BQP=\angle DAQ$.

Let $\infty$ be the point at infinity along $\seg{AD}$, $\seg{BC}$. By Desargue involution from $Q$ to $ACBD$, an involution swaps $(\seg{QA},\seg{QB})$, $(\seg{QC},\seg{QD})$, $(\seg{QP},\seg{Q\infty})$. This involution is reflection across the bisector of $\angle AQB$, and the result follows.
