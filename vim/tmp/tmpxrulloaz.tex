Triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in circle $\omega$. Points $P$ and $Q$ are on side $\overline{AB}$ with $AP<AQ$. Rays $CP$ and $CQ$ meet $\omega$ again at $S$ and $T$ (other than $C$), respectively. If $AP=4,PQ=3,QB=6,BT=5,$ and $AS=7$, then $ST=\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Notice that \[ST=\frac{5\cdot 7}{13}(A,T;B,S)\stackrel{C}{=}\frac{35}{13}(A,Q;B,P)=\frac{35}{13}\cdot\frac{13}6\cdot\frac34=\frac{35}8,\]
and the requested sum is $35+8=043$.
