Positive integers $b_4$ and $b_6$ have the property that there is a unique positive integer $b_5$ such that\[1>\frac{b_4}{4^2}>\frac{b_5}{5^2}>\frac{b_6}{6^2}.\]
If $b_4+b_6=24$, what is the unique value of $b_5$?

---

To pick a starting point for our search, we consider the least $b_4$ so that $\frac{b_4}{4^2}>\frac{b_6}{6^2}$; that is, \[\frac94>\frac{b_6}{b_4}=\frac{24-b_4}{b_4}\implies b_4>\frac{96}{13}>7.\]
As such, we check $(b_4,b_6)=(8,16)$. This yields \[\frac8{4^2}>\frac{12}{5^2}>\frac{16}{6^2},\]
so $b_5=12$.

\begin{remark}
    To see that no other $b_4>8$ work, check that in these cases, \[\frac{b_4}{4^2}-\frac{b_6}{6^2}\ge\frac9{16}-\frac{15}{36}=\frac7{48}>\frac2{25},\]
    so we conclude by the Pidgeonhole Principle that there are at least two $b_5/5^2$, with $b_5\in\mathbb Z$, obeying \[\frac{b_4}{4^2}>\frac{b_5}{5^2}>\frac{b_6}{6^2}.\]
\end{remark}
