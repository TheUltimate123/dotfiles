Let $P_1P_2\cdots P_{2020}$ be a regular $2020$-gon, and let $P_i=P_{i+2020}$ for all $i$. For every $i=1,2,\ldots,2020$, draw line $P_iP_{i+2}$. Into how many regions do these $2020$ lines divide the interior of the polygon?

For general $n=2020$, the answer is $2n+1=4041$. Basically the lines divide the $n$-gon into a ``middle'' $n$-gon, and each vertex and side determines another region.
