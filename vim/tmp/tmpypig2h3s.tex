David and Marta are happily married and have three children. In this family of five, the average number of siblings of a member of this family is $4$. What is the average of the number of siblings David and Marta have? (Note that David and Marta have siblings who are not part of this family of five.)

Let David, Marta have $a$, $b$ siblings. The children each have $2$ sublings, so \[\frac{a+b+2+2+2}5=4\implies\frac{a+b}2=7.\]
