Let $x$, $y$, and $z$ be real numbers (not necessarily positive) such that $x^4+y^4+z^4+xyz=4$.

Show that $x\le2$ and $\sqrt{2-x}\ge\frac{y+z}{2}$.

It is easy to verify $x\le2$: for instance, we have by AM-GM that
\[0\ge2y^2z^2+x\cdot yz+\left(x^4-4\right).\]
The discriminant (as a polynomial in $yz$) must be nonzero, i.e.
\[0\le x^2-8\left(x^4-4\right)=32+x^2-8x^4.\]
It is easy to verify $x^2\le4$.

Now assume that $y+z\ge0$ and $2-x<\left(\frac{y+z}2\right)^2$. Expanding, we have
\[8<4x+y^2+z^2+2yz.\]
Rewriting using the estimates $4x\le x^4+3$, $y^2\le\frac{y^4+1}2$, $z^2\le\frac{z^4+1}2$, we have
\[8<\left(x^4+3\right)+\left(\frac{y^4+z^4}2+1\right)+2yz\implies4<x^4+2yz+\frac{y^4+z^4}2.\]

Assume for contradiction $x^4+y^4+z^4+xyz=4$; substituting this for the left-hand side and rearranging, we have
\[\frac{y^4+z^4}2<(2-x)yz.\]

However, note that
\[(2-x)yz<yz\left(\frac{y+z}2\right)^2=\frac{\left(y^3z+yz^3\right)+2y^2z^2}4\le\frac{y^4+z^4}2\]
by AM-GM, contradiction.
