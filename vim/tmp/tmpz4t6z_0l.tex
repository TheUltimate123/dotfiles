Let $ABC$ be a triangle with area $1$, and let $M$, $N$, $P$ be the midpoints of $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$, $\overline{AB}$, respectively. A point $X$ is chosen uniformly and at random in the interior of $\triangle ABC$. What is the expected value of the area of the convex hull of $\{M,N,P,X\}$?
(Note: the convex hull of a finite set $S$ in the plane is the smallest convex polygon containing all the elements of $S$.)

There is a $\frac14$ change $X$ is in $\triangle MNP$, and the area is $\frac14$. Otherwise, without loss of generality $X$ is in $\triangle ANP$. The expected area of $\triangle XNP$ is $\frac13$ that of $\triangle ANP$ by symmetry (since the areas of $\triangle XNP$, $\triangle XPA$, $\triangle XAM$ have fixed sum); i.e.\ $\frac1{12}$, so the expected area in this case is $\frac13$. The answer is \[\frac14\cdot\frac14+\frac34\cdot\frac13=\frac5{16}.\]

$\frac5{16}$
