Find all functions $f:\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z$ such that for all integers $a$, $b$, $c$ that satisfy $a+b+c=0$, the following equality holds:
\[f(a)^2+f(b)^2+f(c)^2=2f(a)f(b)+2f(b)f(c)+2f(c)f(a).\]

We will sketch the solution. The answers are, for arbitrary $a$,
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item $f(n)\equiv an^2$;
    \item $f(n)=0$ for even $n$ and $f(n)=a$ for odd $n$; and
    \item $f(n)=0$ for $n\equiv0\pmod4$, $f(n)=a$ for odd $n$, and $f(n)=4a$ for $n\equiv2\pmod4$.
\end{itemize}
With enough effort, these can be verified to work.

Now, if $P(a,b,c)$ denotes the assertion,
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
    \item $P(0,0,0)$ gives $f(0)=0$, and
    \item $P(n,-n,0)$ gives $f(n)=f(-n)$, i.e.\ $f$ even.
\end{itemize}
The rest is an easy but annoying strong induction on $n$, by rewriting the condition as
\[\big(f(a+b)-f(a)-f(b)\big)^2=4f(a)f(b),\]
that we will omit.
