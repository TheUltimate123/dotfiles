Suppose $q_0$, $q_1$, $q_2$, $\ldots$ is an infinite sequence of integers satisfying the following two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),itemsep=0em]
    \item $m-n$ divides $q_m-q_n$ for $m>n\ge0$, and
    \item there is a polynomial $P$ such that $|q_n|<P(n)$ for all $n$.
\end{enumerate}
Prove that there is a polynomial $Q$ such that $q_n=Q(n)$ for all $n$.

Let $d$ be the degree of $P$, and let $Q$ be the (unique) rational polynomial with $Q(i)=q_i$ for $i=0,\ldots,d$. Appropriately scale up everything so that $Q$ has integer coefficients.
\begin{lemma*}
    For all $d$,
    \[\lcm(n,n-1,\ldots,n-d)=O\big(n^{d+1}\big).\]
\end{lemma*}
\begin{proof}
    Evidently $\lcm(n,n-1,\ldots,n-d)\le n(n-1)\cdots(n-d)=O\big(n^{d+1}\big)$. The lower bound can be attained easily via basically any bound; for instance,
    \[\lcm(n,\ldots,n-d)\ge\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-d)}{\prod_{i<j}\gcd(n-i,n-j)}\ge\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-d)}{\prod_{i<j}(j-i)}=O\big(n^{d+1}\big).\]
\end{proof}
\begin{claim*}
    For sufficiently large $n$, we have $q_n=Q(n)$.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
    We must have $q_n\equiv q_i=Q(i)\equiv Q(n)\pmod{n-i}$ for $i=0,\ldots,d$, so
    \[q_n\equiv Q(n)\pmod{\lcm(n,\ldots,n-d)}.\]
    If $q_n\ne Q(n)$, then for some nonzero $k$ we have $q_n=Q(n)+k\lcm(n,\ldots,n-d)=O\big(n^{d+1}\big)$, which will exceed $P(n)$ in absolute value for sufficiently large $n$.
\end{proof}

To finish the proof, observe that for every $m$, we have $q_m\equiv q_n=Q(n)\equiv Q(m)\pmod{n-m}$ for sufficiently large $n$. By taking $n$ large, $q_m=Q(m)$, as needed.
