In the coordinate plane, the points with both coordinates being rational numbers are called \emph{rational points}. For any positive integer $n$, is there a way to use $n$ colors to color every rational point one color such that any line segment with both endpoints being rational points contains the rational points of every color?

Number the segments 1, 2, 3, \ldots. We can prove by induction on $k$ that there is a way to color finitely many rational points such that segments 1, 2, \ldots, $k$ contain rational points of every color.
