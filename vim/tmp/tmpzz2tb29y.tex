Determine all functions $f:\mathbb R_{>0}\to\mathbb  R$ satisfying \[\left(x+\frac1x\right)f(y)=f(xy)+f\left(\frac yx\right)\]
for all $x,y>0$.

The answer is $f(x)=ax+\tfrac bx$ for real numbers $a$ and $b$. It is easy to check that this works; so it suffices to prove that these are the only solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ denote the assertion. Notice that if $f$ and $g$ are solutions to the functional equation, $f+g$ and $f-g$ are also solutions. Given $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, we can easily find $a$ and $b$ such that $f(1)=a+b$ and $f(2)=2a+\tfrac b2$. Shift down to give $f(1)=f(2)=0$. We will show that $f\equiv 0$.

$P(2,2)$ gives \[\frac52f(2)=f(4)+f(1)\implies f(4)=0.\]
Now, $P(2x,2)$ and $P(x,1)$ give \[f(4x)=-f\left(\frac1x\right)=f(x)\]
for all $x$, so $P(2,2x)$ gives \[\frac52f(2x)=f(4x)+f(x)=2f(x)\implies f(2x)=\frac45f(x)\implies f(x)=f(4x)=\frac{16}{25}f(x),\]
which immediately yields $f\equiv0$, as desired.
